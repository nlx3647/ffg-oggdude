After impact, the torpedo breaks open to release the droids. They scurry in all directions across the ship and use their laser cutters, magclaws, ion clamps, and other tools to burrow through the hull and attack ship systems. In short order, the droids can spread throughout a ship.\n[P]It can take weeks to clear an infestation-if the vessel survives that long. Many engineers serving with the Alliance (or aboard pirate crews) despise these weapons, as they make salvage difficult or downright impossible. On top of this, unsubstantiated rumors persist of termite droids lying dormant in salvaged systems, only to emerge and infect any vessel that inherits the affected parts.\n[P]Additional termite torpedoes cost 900 credits for a set of three.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 63 - Fully Operational[h4]<div>After vehicle is hit by a termite torpedo, for remainder of encounter, whenever crew performs a check, attacker can spend [TH][TH] to have ship suffer 2 hull trauma or system strain, and can spend [DE] to inflict a Critical Hit.
