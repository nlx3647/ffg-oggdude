[B]Seekers begin the game with a Force rating of 1.[b] \n\n[P][H4]A SEEKER'S ROLE[h4] \n\n[P]It is not uncommon for some Force adepts to feel compelled to travel throughout the galaxy to aid those in need and to oppose those who use the dark side. While some might focus their attentions in cities and urban centers, the need can be just as great far \nfrom the heart of galactic civilization. A Force adept who is willing and able to travel and work in these environments can help ease crushing poverty or crippling plagues of hunger and disease. He can also discover new Force techniques, find sensitives in need of training, and at times halt dangerous threats that could otherwise fester in isolation. A Seeker must be capable of doing all of these things, while traveling far from any meaningful support network. \n[P]Seekers generally take a very pragmatic view toward the Force. Operating independently, they consider it to be one of the tools in their arsenal, but not the only one. For a Seeker, preparedness and adaptability are paramount. They cannot count on finding the right tools for the job in the isolated areas in which they travel. As such, they learn to be flexible and adapt quickly to find the best equipment from what is available. In some environments, this may mean discovering information about flora and fauna that is previously undocumented. In such situations, the Force can be the most reliable asset, and its flexibility can aid them in selecting and using whatever else is at hand. \n\n[P]This flexibility is vital for a Seeker. Some of these characters travel at the direction of the Force, allowing fortune and chance to select their destinations and their traveling companions. Others work within the confines of larger groups. They may be troubleshooters. bounty hunters, envoys, or even traveling merchants. The variety of work means the Seeker must be prepared to quickly adapt to these changing situations and to make the most effective use possible of the tools that are at hand.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 84 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attr30jyi4uhgl66o23m":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrp35anuhkhvjfc24j":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attruhnuag03nxfdixrx":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrvy0ia2wcu5e2ayck":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrlpreekbnnwrppyf5":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrknsz6tn4tasuvmc8":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr7v2zgzec6sgwityn":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrhhmagtp5g26aba9a":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrmxifsi9e7jrxe6en":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attriant56cs46i8clzq":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attri5ept3jloggrezv3":{"mod":"Xenology","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrtljmfzg1uik9tgao":{"mod":"Xenology","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrkujw2k910aai9wt6":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":"1"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SEEKER"}},"_id":"0SaBUOR4BKPdKS5Y"}

[B]Sentinels begin the game with a Force rating of 1.[b]\n\n[P][H4]A SENTINEL'S ROLE[h4] \n\n[P]Every city has its secrets, and every shining beacon of civilization has its seedy underworld. Within these shadowy depths, miscreants and malcontents prey on the helpless, committing heinous crimes and leaving misery and chaos in their wake. \n\n[P]Most law enforcement agencies try to combat criminals without violating the very laws the agencies exist to uphold. Thus, their agents must abide by strict regulations that restrain their behavior. Even institutions that exist to uphold evil laws, such as the Empire, have codes of conduct that apply to their enforcers. The Sentinel, however, plays by his own rules.\n\n[P]During the time of the Old Republic, the Jedi Sentinels were Force adepts who blended combat expertise and training in the Force with a more pragmatic approach to their duties. Sentinels embraced practical technologies and utilized techniques borrowed from police forces, skip tracers, spies, and even law-breakers. Sentinels relied on quick thinking and cunning to accomplish their tasks, and they quickly found their calling in the owns of urban environments. tin the streets. Sentinels could fight criminals by using their own tactics against them. \n\n[P]Such an approach was not without risk. Even as Sentinels skirted the law to enforce justice, they skirted the dark side of their own morality as well. A Sentinel had to maintain constant vigilance over his own actions, analyzing each choice he made to ensure it was the right one. The best Sentinels avoided falling to the dark side by cultivating a fierce intellect and a brilliant cunning-to see all sides of a no-win situation and find the unexpected solution. \n\n[P]Although the Empire has long since wiped out the Jedi Order, and with it the Jedi Sentinels, some remain who follow these guiding principles. Many quick-witted Force-sensitives living in urban areas find themselves unconsciously adopting a Sentinel's tactics as they unlock their own hidden potential. \n\n[P]Characters with a strong moral imperative may see these crusading skills as a means of Investigating powerful individuals. If they find powerful villains who are above the law, then employing less ethical approaches might be the only means to bring these rogues to justice. Under these circumstances, a Sentinel could readily justify deception and even minor crimes if they were undertaken to assure that a tyrant's excesses could be curbed.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 90 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attr1zem83162kodff3c":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attril3ymgfzhxc6cmaz":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attryos11sn1wvlw44gj":{"mod":"Core Worlds","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrxbf3q6byoep6o3uw":{"mod":"Core Worlds","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrdfp91gh3wqtwuok5":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr8tcnzlrko3lrmz8e":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attry9p7jioyzhh3fdwl":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrdzo0j4e78emdh6i1":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrzovdon3z8nvh8tzt":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrqn0iccaf3gzf2kq7":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrwxtjvs807m7yqajy":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrfv2pvttrjes7ybqy":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrv4ky9k7z9fijmj0h":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":"1"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SENTINEL"}},"_id":"2ZlUkou7uO2zTLNR"}

[B]The Consular begins play with a Force rating of 1.[b]\n\n[P][H4]A CONSULAR'S ROLE[h4] \n\n[P]The Consular focuses on the goal of achieving peace and harmony through positive discourse. Followers of this career try to avoid physical conflict whenever possible. Instead, they have faith in the Force to fuel basic compassion in all sentient beings. They believe that it is always more effective to have an intelligent discussion about a problem and then solve it through negotiations and other peaceful means than to engage in conflict to resolve it. They are opposed to needless violence but know that when confronting true evil, they must be willing to take decisive action. A Consular prides himself in knowing when to speak words of peace, and when the time for words is over. \n\n[P]Followers of this career are not Jedi Consulars of the now-fallen Republic. but they do embrace some of the same philosophies and practices. During the time of the Galactic Civil War. Consulars are a relatively rare breed. Imperial negotiations are most commonly handled through a position of vastly superior military might. Consequently. the Empire has little use for their peaceful approaches.\n\n[P]In contrast, the Rebel Alliance has a far greater need for Consulars. As the various smaller Rebel groups come into contact with one another, they need negotiators capable of building a foundation for an alliance. Consulars have helped build the foundations for the fight for freedom, bringing groups of diverse backgrounds and needs together and joining them in common cause against injustice.\n\n[P]Even as the Rebel Alliance becomes a well-established entity, the need for Consulars continue. Maintaining the Rebellion's push against the Empire requires assistance from a broad range of different groups Consulars are capable of working with planetary governments—and even large corporations—to procure the equipment necessary to maintain and grow the Rebellion. They are also instrumental in persuading worlds to risk attempts at throwing off the shackles of the Empire. \n\n[P]Of course, not every Consular has necessarily played a role on the galactic stage. In fact, many help settle disputes closer to home, in small villages or planetary governments. Most Consulars see helping two feuding families find peace to be as rewarding as convincing an entire world to join the fight against the Empire. \n\nBeginning characters—particularly those who are cognizant of their Force abilities—are most likely to have learned their techniques from relatively obscure traditions. Alternatively, characters who do not recognize their abilities could be extremely competent negotiators, such as accomplished political, religious. and business leaders. Any of these Individuals might unwittingly tap into their Force abilities during the course of their work. This could provide the basis for a character who denies any knowledge of Force techniques while simultaneously depending on them.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 66 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attrtnceuflfamkqodq8":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrjgzvn8scsfrzfht9":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attruk3egsw7nsldlgq0":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrcwj8ssu7y1l6w2gm":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrstg6ed665nmj4k4b":{"mod":"Education","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrzyyq797ptaci66m0":{"mod":"Education","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrfukp1bi0xccct6x7":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrzfh5z12ph54c8jps":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrodd1ise8ok0nu8zo":{"mod":"Lore","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrdlzml7b2yxka3y6m":{"mod":"Lore","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrvobgzo85xjprlmnw":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrjup0tkstd29qfggs":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrlwy219gkxarkffu8":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":"1"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"CONSULAR"}},"_id":"KtJsfOGB86FUrGZq"}

Whether flying in the pilot's seat of a starfighter, wielding a lightsaber on the field of battle, or blazing away with a blaster pistol. Warriors excel in combat of all types. \n\n[P]Legends indicate that the Jedi Order's origins began with warriors who worked to integrate Force techniques into their physical training. Even in the absence of the Old Republic's guardians, this association remains. The Force can give strength to those who need it, and Warriors excel at exploiting that strength. They become a physical manifestation of the Force, willing and ready to overcome those who would inflict harm. \n\n[P]The Warrior's greatest strength, however, can also be his most dangerous weakness. Endless aggression can be a path toward the dark side. A wise individual must recognize that violence has its place but is not the only possible answer. A Warrior can inflict substantial and precise damage. However, even carefully applied attacks can still have far-reaching consequences. Because of this, it can be every bit as important for a Warrior to recognize when it is more appropriate not to attack. Some individuals who follow this career consider this sense of judgment to be the most important aspect of their training. \n[P]Warriors can come from a broad range of different cultures and environments. Physical conflict is every bit as common within the civilized and technologically advanced worlds of the Core as it Is within the less structured societies of the Outer Rim.

They are most often from the Core Worlds, where they were well educated and part of the cultural and professional elite. A Colonist doesn't tend to have the training to survive in areas of high conflict, and he isn't particularly adept at physical exploits. \n\n[P]What he does possess, however, is a keen grasp of the bigger picture, and he usually has both the knowledge to understand problems and the capacity to get them solved. He probably came to the Outer Rim to create opportunities for himself, or to find a better life than what he left behind. If he cannot find that better life, he'll apply all of his knowledge to the task of creating it, and he'll use his considerable social skills to gather like-minded allies to his cause. \n\n[P]Of course, not all Colonists are necessarily altruistic in their pursuits. If knowledge is power, and power corrupts, then it follows that the Colonist is well-suited to take what he knows and exploit it for personal wealth. With charisma and street smarts, a Colonist might gather quite a team of specialists together to both watch his back and see to it that his enemies are brought to heel as he solidifies his power base. Countless Outer Rim worlds have become the personal fiefs of Colonists with bold ideas and willing followers.\n\n[P]Of course, some Colonists fail in their pursuits, and run afoul of the law or their fellows. These Colonists are forced to flee their lives of luxury and survive wherever they can. Some of these individuals may fall in with less reputable, even criminal, individuals. Luckily, these unfortunate Colonists sometimes find their unique skill sets are in high demand. \n\n[P]The clever Colonists—the ones most likely to survive their first few months in the Outer Rim—figure out how to parlay their knowledge and talents into currency and contacts. Providing excellent advice, medical aid, or valuable knowledge can easily endear a Colonist to a warlord or gang leader, giving him the very thing he needs most: security. From a position of relative safety, a wise Colonist will begin gathering connections and data, building up a network that he can one day exploit for his aims, whatever they may be. \n\n[P]Colonists are the consummate leaders, negotiators, inspirational speakers, and strategists. A Colonist can take any small group of capable operators and turn them into a true force to be reckoned with. A capable Colonist in a group can mean the difference between just getting by and doing something truly spectacular in the galaxy.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 62 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attrfojca4iqkwb1ut2i":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrwpvd1a6dbds37830":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attronrhj68zw3lj4d81":{"mod":"Core Worlds","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr8jufsw19jvlbcngb":{"mod":"Core Worlds","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrkvpv79wqmmntr53q":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrxizk0qo9koo178w9":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrcd0ef94gknmh79g8":{"mod":"Education","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrd9poz7tsjsioarfz":{"mod":"Education","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrv0isuurmgh7anymo":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrry8fvgs0zzq7m869":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrzn439jidtdp9iys4":{"mod":"Lore","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrz6ty7uooddjuqxuo":{"mod":"Lore","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrkghc26q7rtz3upl8":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attre9n67uu1zfo5aitm":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrwf5z7jt8a9h89plz":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attroktnt8anxoioct2b":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"COLO"}},"_id":"cKtjOF5BKe2WN2Or"}

Most engineers prefer working with technology over people, especially in light of how chaotic the latter are. While some Engineers are fully (and eagerly) aware of the massive destruction their creations are capable of, most are merely fascinated with the challenge of creating something new, or fixing something thought beyond repair.

They travel the hyperspace lanes, system to system, planet to planet, bringing what people want and need (and cannot get through legitimate means). \n\n[P]Unfortunately, that freedom is often an illusion; many Smugglers find themselves indebted to powerful people, having been forced to take a marker on their ships just to stay in business. Such markers inevitably lead Smugglers into a kind of indentured servitude unless they can figure a way out of it. That requires a very big 'score\" of some kind—a job of such financial reward, the Smuggler can buy his ship back and afford to operate on his own again. \n\n[P]Few Smugglers survive that kind of job.

With tariffs, quantity restrictions, and outright banning of even basic necessities being shipped to worlds not fully under Imperial Law, a great many people would be scratching out the poorest sort of existence, or perhaps dying outright due to lack of food and medicine. Smugglers' ships are the lifelines that keep many distant population centers going. \n\n[P]Of course, the most profitable cargoes are the ones that will land someone in the Kessel spice mines if he's caught with them.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 80 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attrtgu2lupl6ibrpo8x":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrlfaxnnqsvzi9c8id":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr8tl497sslym9g2sn":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrdvle637nzcrez5vb":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrqvwhmv3j6n9lo94j":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr6pi86kze9c4lajna":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrig8tlc3r65ql52kk":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrrhm6ptvy78rrggxs":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrbx6b052df9j7sxuq":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr653erv5tn7yel1x8":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrz4r42flrllkd0i3r":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrsoj3ys2r1jklcn9c":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr3g5t56f4dvrws747":{"mod":"Underworld","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr45thdng3h3jlg97i":{"mod":"Underworld","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrgwolbs15530niljw":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr9mz5tv39830d3ues":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SMUG"}},"_id":"gEhM0yGHFwRKIl83"}

From the time they first open their eyes, a strong connection to the Force colors their perception of the world surrounding them. They constantly perceive the ebb and flow of its energies between all living things. To many Mystics, the Force is as important a guide and mentor as their family and trusted friends. It teaches them to trust their instincts more than any training or instruction, for those instincts come from the Force.\n\n[P]Because Mystics dwell so deeply in the Force, they often learn to master a broad range of Force powers. Training and practice can, of course, enhance their aptitude, but not all of them require a teacher. Rather, many Mystics simply intuit their powers through experience and their connection to the Force. Many Mystics accept this as the natural way of things. They strongly believe that the Force guides and provides for them as long as they remember to remain open and aware of its presence. \n\n[P]Many Mystics come from a culture where their connection to the Force has made them a person of importance. In some instances, they might have served as an advisor or even a magistrate. In other cases, their role could have been more religious or shamanic. They are likely to expect a certain degree of deference because of their previous experiences. This means many Mystics develop a powerful charisma and captivating presence. Some Mystics come by this naturally, able to convince others of what they have seen using soft words and persuasive arguments. Others work tirelessly to develop these personality traits, knowing that a compliment (or even a lie) in the right ear at the right time can quickly advance their goals.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 78 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attrwba6cs7a0mxkbc45":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrxxqquny6y0mk1yrf":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr8dzgvgj1n0s3w56d":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrmuik72e5ol9tlmnj":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrdum01qvh2tnrogr3":{"mod":"Lore","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrin7c5p6qpycdppji":{"mod":"Lore","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrdizxk9mxhdpom7oc":{"mod":"Outer Rim","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attryyhtmdfi5zfvkosv":{"mod":"Outer Rim","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr5fyphtur2y354a8y":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr6wrx2zdhrb117llu":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attruw8dyuz5omufea6c":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrggjn8ez280vyfgbm":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attro6y84nfz1nxgsm0v":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":"1"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"MYSTIC"}},"_id":"hIz0gcmrqghsdzub"}

The Explorer is a free agent; he makes his own way, tracks his own discoveries, and arranges his own special deals and connections.

Gadgeteer-oriented Bounty Hunters and Smugglers are most likely to befriend a Technician in a group. This can be a mutually beneficial relationship, considering all of the wonderful things a technically proficient individual can do for someone's gear. \n\n[P]Like Pilots and Doctors, Technicians of almost any specialization will have a relatively easy time finding work in the Outer Rim. Every operation, from small farmsteads to large space stations, has need of those who can keep the tech running. Criminal overlords particularly enjoy having a Technician on their payroll, not only to take care of their many assets, but also to craft the occasional \"toy\" for them with which to surprise their enemies.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 86 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attr5tnsdt5ppg85kj80":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrcj08bfj9qhteiins":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attraal36soxc3bnh9qn":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrd2lgmgechnel0n78":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attriwwbjys69txrg2fh":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr99nm5ohyzol3htlg":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr785cqzso30pmryuh":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrl4ebwd7zv8vglaq0":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr25io5zrzwbozl6cr":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr0ytiaddho33i53ds":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrnri4mdtpya84aut2":{"mod":"Outer Rim","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr13ima47empahmb3z":{"mod":"Outer Rim","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrerpbldiusj0t28vc":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrfb2vq9lsdqba7oev":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrbuz9eypwhr7bfww5":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrke61o43416cxjykc":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"TECHNICIAN"}},"_id":"rr6BTYghBYY8w6JN"}

He automatically gains one rank in four of these skills (of his choosing) without spending experience, and he receives a discount when he spends experience to purchase ranks in any of these skills. \n\n[P][H4]A Hired Gun's Role[h4]\n\n[P]When it comes to fighting, the Hired Gun is at the forefront. He's less of an independent operator than the Bounty Hunter, preferring to have a defined mission, an objective to achieve, and some credits to spend when the job is done. Hired Guns are muscle and applied force, meant to defend or attack as the situation requires. They deal damage or protect others for credits, and this makes them simple and sometimes refreshingly direct. \n\n[P]A Hired Gun one typically encounters in the Outer Rim likely came from one of three kinds of backgrounds; he may have been a soldier for the Empire (or, possibly, even for the Old Republic before its fall), he might have served with a planetary or organizational force of some kind, or he simply came up hard, learning how to shoot and fight because that was the only way he could survive. However he came by them, the Hired Gun has the kinds of skills and talents that make it fairly easy to find work in the Outer Rim and the fringes of society.\n\n[P]Many Hired Guns are true mercenaries, either working for themselves or contracted to a guild or company of some kind. Much like Bounty Hunters, the Hired Guns who are part of a guild tend to enjoy a great deal of support. They do not, however, have much in the way of freedom. More than a few Hired Guns have walked away from contracts that either violated their personal ethics or left them feeling completely exploited with terrible terms of service. Unfortunately, such mercenaries are left watching their backs for years after. \n\n[P]Independent Hired Guns enjoy the greatest freedom, yet they also spend a lot of time just trying to find a good job, and preferably one that doesn't give them a life expectancy measured in days. Reputation can mean everything for such professionals, yet a simple test of skills and competency may often result in a better arrangement if the right employer is impressed.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 74 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attr6c1zygf7p6hqph1k":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr8yh6dk0v80nd16t0":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrkyu1r74muh40wnkx":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attri1i6lvkgsdewoovq":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrkjyn48uit7q0uvvs":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrumhdipv05km7ovtl":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrn0j6y7t62azrjoxe":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr1cuko4oz4kqx5tdg":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrjqyx4psag1acdumk":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attryuxwt8g5lpdkfr2p":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrsa7wp4c6ezylqlv9":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrpsi14ewg1u8o28u7":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr9sy0kvafczbun6gs":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrskokitg6vud53ymj":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrj4x4w8fdrgyiped8":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr06u0hhxuu17cmgqp":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"HIREDGUN"}},"_id":"rzRk6hPHgfDYAkg0"}
{"name":"Bounty Hunter","type":"career","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Bounty Hunter[h4]\n\n[P]The Bounty Hunter's eight career skills are [B]Athletics, Brawl, Perception, Piloting (Planetary), Piloting (Space), Ranged (Heavy), Streetwise,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b]. He automatically gains one rank in four of these skills (of his choosing) without spending experience, and he receives a discount when he spends experience to purchase ranks in any of these skills. \n\n[P][H4]A BOUNTY HUNTER'S ROLE[h4]\n\n[P]The name says it all: this is a hunter who seeks to collect bounties for his work. Bounty Hunters tend to be feared, reviled, looked down upon—and in great demand throughout the galaxy. They are expert trackers, brutal combatants, and effective investigators. They tend to prefer skulduggery, stealth, and traps over frontal assaults, but the most respected Bounty Hunters will do whatever it takes to catch their quarries and collect their fees. \n\n[P]Bounty Hunters generally fall within three categories: Imperial Bounty Hunters, Guild Bounty Hunters, or Independents. Imperial Bounty Hunters are essentially on permanent contract to the Imperial Security Bureau (or a similar arm of Imperial law), and they never take assignments from corporations, smaller governments, or individuals. They are highly-trusted members of the extended law-enforcement community of the Empire, usually ex-military personnel that prefer a less-regimented (if possibly dangerous) way to serve. \n[P]Those Bounty Hunters who join a guild enjoy many excellent benefits: room and board wherever the guild has a presence, exceptional training and access to high-end equipment as needed for specific assignments, and a steady stream of jobs given to them by the guild brokers acting on their behalf. The downside to all of this is the fact that Guild Bounty Hunters have little-to-no say in what jobs they get, and failure to accept an assignment is grounds for immediate termination of a guild contract. \n\n[P]The greatest freedom comes with being an Independent Bounty Hunter; it also comes with the greatest challenges and dangers. Although Independents often take Imperial contracts, which are usually the most readily available and lucrative, they enjoy knowing they are not exactly a part of the Empire. Not being a part of a guild also serves an Independent Bounty Hunter's sensibilities; he can pick and choose his contracts as he likes, and has only himself to credit for success or failure. \n\n[P]Player Characters are almost certainly going to be either Guild or Independent Hunters. However, regardless of what type of Bounty Hunter is played, the character will need to have a current and legitimate Imperial Peace-Keeping Certificate (IPKC). This is the specific license that all Bounty Hunters are required to have on file with the Empire in order to operate as professionals. Without such documentation and status, a Bounty Hunter is little more than a kidnapper and, possibly, a murderer. Any character with the Bounty Hunter career automatically gains an IPKC—unless the player would prefer his character not start with one. Although this may seem like an odd choice, it could make for a particularly compelling story or character background.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 56 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attryoa48we23fss8odh":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrh6n5qplvs6e83kpv":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr9zcexnk42rfzbznv":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrkvsyd67d9af29718":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrjbohse6qtdj6o41y":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrytwzvm3lefaiy2yi":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrlfxylm8aslepyzql":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attregtydbbr3htk6g4q":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrb6f4cxh4ku6wi010":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrarebpklgebjwcba1":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrj34e8082v3ghtrjb":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrq9iry5fkpfyilda4":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrr94eh958z98n6djq":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr25tg152fhxje0s27":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr5zyrxsby4gp826bz":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr27bbuqtaq74te6kg":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"BOUNT"}},"_id":"wml2lv5WqKXAb29k"}

A single Spy, in the right place I at the right moment, can save (or destroy) many thousands of lives, with a single well-timed action. Most military forces (along with governments, criminal factions, and large corporations) place a great deal of emphasis on crafting an effective corps of espionage operatives.\n\n[P]The primary role of any Spy is the gathering of intelligence—information about what is happening in the areas of operation, as well as what the enemy is doing—for those in command of Allied forces. There are many ways to do this, meaning there are many types of Spies with divergent specialties. Some focus on infiltrating the ranks of the enemy and gathering data from within, while others focus on external observations of troop and asset movements. Some take advantage of the dependency of modern military forces on electronic means of data collation, tapping into their opponents' networks and siphoning off everything that can be snagged. \n\n[P]The Alliance's reliance on Spies cannot be understated. Together with other specialist operatives, Spies are critical to the Rebellion's chance for success. Their skills and talents play a crucial role in balancing the scales against the Empire's overwhelming superiority in both forces and resources. As the war progresses, however, the Alliance can no longer treat its Spies as untouchable assets, never to be unduly risked; more and more, Spies are being called on to make direct strikes against the targets from which they are sent to gain information.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 94 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attre9snbic1zibcwdci":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrocginrs8s1d0mlqm":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attri62qdai6el80adu5":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrc3orto9i5bzzq4xm":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attreua84mkaggjxy2p0":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrwk2cjgkszbyf00ux":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr46o61vqu1jmaxw6a":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrlk76y8080zi7g4vi":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr7f5lmmtllq25a39w":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attry3aocnsqwkg69ygi":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attryb5trdtfmbsivant":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr6d6cly17kd3r985b":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr0osdm5hba7u97sxd":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrlzetrlf1xy9iv53k":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attr04xqmychaxdh1rqw":{"mod":"Warfare","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrzxkp8uprz5pdwcja":{"mod":"Warfare","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SPY"}},"_id":"z2SQIKnPL3TELaoP"}

[B]The Guardian begins with a Force rating of 1.[b]\n\n[P][H4]A GUARDIAN'S ROLE[h4] \n\n[P]Adherents of the Guardian career are driven by a strong sense of responsibility and compassion. They recognize their affinity for the Force gives them the power—and responsibility—to help the helpless and aid the oppressed. Guardians tend to be blunt and forthright, using their prodigious combat prowess and natural leadership skills to directly intercede where they are needed most. \n\n[P]Most Guardians have a swagger about them, a cool confidence coupled with an air of nobility and authority. This poise is often well deserved. Guardians are capable of surviving and winning battles against overwhelming odds. Their martial training tends to focus almost exclusively on defense and resilience, leaving a Guardian as hard as granite. Hordes of opponents break upon a Guardian like waves upon shoreline rocks, leaving themselves exhausted and open to devastating counterattacks. \n\n[P]Alone, this combat prowess would be impressive, but a Guardian couples his abilities with his connection to the Force. This combination makes the Guardian far more than a mere thug, inspiring compassion and concern for those he protects. A Guardian's defensive combat style matches this concern for life. Rather than make aggressive moves, he gives his opposition every chance to relent and choose a peaceful resolution. However, if they attack, the Guardian quickly demonstrates why their choice was the wrong one. \n\n[P]In many cases, a Guardian becomes established within a particular geographic region. This might be as large as a group of planets within a sector or as small as a neighborhood in a large city. A Guardian who focuses on a region in this way can choose to take stewardship of it. Notably, such stewardship comes out of a sense of responsibility and duty rather than any actual authority. Guardians seldom assume political power. Instead, they act in accordance with their internal moral compass, as guided by the Force, to ensure that everyone under their protection receives the justice they deserve. \n[P]Other Guardians follow the calling of the Force to travel and aid beings in need wherever they might find them. Many such Guardians wander in a seemingly aimless fashion, apparently letting random chance direct them where they might need to go. Almost invariably. their voyages soon lead them to people who desperately need help.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 72 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"attrbbwlgjf4sc75bn42":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attry15rk1z00dedr15e":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrb4pxprrq5sn44bzv":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr6z9xrwt0rhrrgi9b":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attryd88hwsp63n54vtv":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrrr3m139s20d9tgwe":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrhkai8i28y79oywto":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attrpk29djn591i49lic":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrtpszuxogewqoop4p":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr5kjrf3iqv67ro00q":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrfg152ue656trhsoh":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"attr1578r6hqrftvwos3":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"attrnt1dlyir39oivbkc":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":"1"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GUARD"}},"_id":"zriuO0Lii70oZtaX"}
