{"name":"PTB-625 Heavy Bomber","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]PTB-625 Heavy Bomber[h3]\n\nOne of a trio of heavy fightercraft produced by a joint Incom/SubPro venture, the PTB-625 is an old, tried-and-true airspeeder design that has proven itself time and again during its decades of service. Designed as a heavy atmospheric bomber, the PTB-625 was first introduced into the Republic Navy arsenal alongside the ARC-170 reconnaissance fighter and the NTB-630 orbital bomber sometime before 22 BBY. A design departure from other Incom/SubPro products, the PTB-625 is a massive flying wing-style airspeeder driven by six powerful ion turbofan thrusters mounted in the trailing edge of the wing/fuselage. These airspeeders carry a crew of five in two cramped, pressurized cabins with just enough storage room for a small flight bag and a sidearm at each station. There is also a small crew area between the cabins that contains two bunks, a small refresher and even smaller galley for long-range bombing missions. PTB-625s are also equipped with ejection capsules for each crew member that automatically seal and launch through the speeder's belly should the computers sense an imminent crash. \n\n[P]Optimized for strategic bombing missions, the PTB-625 has a cavernous modular ventral-mounted bomb bay that can carry any kind of ordnance from standard proton or concussion bombs to sophisticated rotary launchers designed to launch heavy missiles from beyond visual range. In addition to the speeder's ordnance, it also carries turret and fixed position-mounted auto-blasters and light laser cannons for fending off interceptors and incoming missiles. Although the PTB-625 is slower than its space-going siblings, even today it is faster than most heavy airspeeders of similar type and role. While certainly a powerful and capable airspeeder, the PTB-625 is considered antiquated in modern orders of battle, its role overtaken by multi-role speeders and small, fast, dedicated strike fighters. Despite their age and limited usefulness however, numerous PTB-625s still serve with the Rebel Alliance, brought in when overwhelming force is required to destroy heavy Imperial installations and planetary infrastructure.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":100,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":130000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"PTB-625 Heavy Bomber","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Typically deployed in occupied cities and in Imperial military facilities rather than on the front line, they are a common fight in urban centers with high amounts of unrest. Remarkably versatile, Occupiers are able to fight, provide supporting fire, and carry troops and cargo with equal ease.\n[P]Small and simple, these vehicles are roughly the size of a heavy speeder truck. They have an armored, wedge-shaped forward crew compartment that holds the three-person crew in extremely cramped conditions. Aft of the crew compartment is a long, flat truck bed that can carry light cargoes or a squad of troopers. Thanks to their tracks and responsive drivetrain, these tanks can stop, turn, and maneuver in incredibly tight quarters. Heavily armed for vehicles of their class, GAVw tanks carry a pair of light blaster cannons mounted forward in the reinforced bow and twinned medium lasers mounted on port and starboard sponsons. In addition, a light repeating blaster can be mounted on a pintle near the main access hatch for anti-infantry and light anti-vehicle use in tight quarters.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 122 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":22,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":35,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":45000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"TX-225 GAVw Combat Assault Tank","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

The result was an eye-catching vehicle, partly inspired by the zalaaca species from Naboo. It has four reversejointed legs, a lithe multi-jointed body, and a long tail that serves as a counterbalance and rudder, as well as antennae for the sensor array housed in the rear of the body. The front console is styled to be vaguely reminiscent of a predatory animal face, with a menacing auto-blaster slung beneath. It seats a single pilot, with up to one passenger riding tandem.\n[P]While the unique design of the zalaaca walker provides impressive acceleration and agility, the experience of riding one is best described as violent, startling, and challenging. Perhaps due to the Baktoid engineers' expertise in drone production, the zalaaca\nwalker has a reputation for inflicting motion sickness on riders who attempt sharp maneuvers. Still, the zalaaca walker is impressively durable, fast, and adapts well to a wide variety of complex terrains in the hands of a skilled pilot.\n[P]Very few zalaaca walkers were produced, but rumor has it that nearly all of them were donated to the Alliance to Restore the Republic as thanks for granting asylum to the fleeing Baktoid employees when the corporation was overtaken by the Empire.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 58 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":9,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":14500,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Versatile-Athletic Walker","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Auto-Blaster","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Auto-Blaster[h3]\n\nAuto blasters are rapid-fire variants of common blaster cannons.

The platform is several meters thick to shield its inner workings against the environment and it houses powerful repulsorlifts and retractable landing gear.\n[P]The Techno Union found these platforms useful for their lava mining operations on Mustafar, and ordered a new heavy duty UH model for harsh environments like that of the lava world. As the new UH-XH Heavy Work Platform was expected to work directly above active lava flows, Baktoid added even more resilient metal shielding to its sides and to the bottom of the platform.

It is produced by Farwan & Glott, a small, boutique producer of Podracers and high performance Podracer parts. The 8T8, also known as the Twin Block2 Special, is a remarkably agile, maneuverabilite-focused Podracer powered by a pair of LGN-19 Magna-Pulse ion drives designed for use in starfighters and patrol boats. Instead of having the engines mounted in free-flouting nacelles connected to the cockpit by control cables, the Twin Block2's engines are hard-mounted directly to the Podracer cockpit via a pair of short, reinforced, fully faired spars. This places the engines aft of the pilot, giving the vehicle a more traditional airspeeder appearance. While a radical configuration for a Podracer, the hard-mounted nacelles give the 8T8 better control thanks to the stiffer hull offering a stable platform for the engines.\n[P]The Twin Block2's cockpit is another oddity in Podracer construction. It features a more aerodynamic shape and a fully enclosed pilot's compartment with advanced safety and control features. It even has a factory equipped ejection system,  an almost unheard of luxury in Prodracing circles. These features—and its advanced handling and braking system—increase pilot safety and comfort at the cost of speed and acceleration. Despite all of its technical advances, and the nearly unmatched power of its ion engines, the 8T8 is among the slower of the current crop of factory customs, due to its weight and its overbearing pilot assistance system.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 56 - Endless Vigil[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":4,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":7,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":16200,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"FG 8T8-T","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"FG8T8T"}},"_id":"CYsQLcI3E33ue7uY"}

Designed as a self-propelled artillery piece, the walker has an angular armored hull perched atop two multi-jointed legs. Its profile resembles that of the forward hull section of an AT-TE. A smaller, retractable third leg mounted forward of the main walking legs is deployed to steady the vehicle when it moves over difficult ground and to brace it when it fires its big artillery gun. Despite its awkward appearance, the AT-AP is relatively well balanced and is no more prone to stability issues than a bipedal walker.\n[P]The AT-AP's main gun is a powerful, long-range mass driver mounted in the forward hull. This big cannon throws a solid durasteel penetrator at hypersonic speeds over extreme distances and, with proper targeting data, can hit targets beyond visual range. To keep the mass driver on target, the AT-AP is equipped with a sophisticated targeting and data-relay suite combined with integrated recoil compensation and gyrostabilization systems. The deadly accuracy exhibited by these walkers during the Clone Wars earned the AT-AP the nickname \"Sniper Tank.\" In addition to the mass driver, the AT-AP mounts a heavy laser cannon in an open-topped, dorsal-mounted turret for short-range anti-vehicle work and an underslung heavy repeating blaster to protect itself from enemy troops and droids.\n[P]Production of the AT-AP has continued since the fall of the Republic, and the dangerous little walker was adopted by the Imperial Army to support its new AT-AT and AT-ST walkers.

Despite their respectable\ndefenses, Chariots are rarely seen on the front lines.\nInstead, they are typically used to move quickly about a\nbattlefield, appearing wherever and whenever they are\nneeded at strategically important points to provide assistance,\nor to whisk officers away from dangerous areas.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 51 - Lead by Example[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Long","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":40000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"LAVR QH-7 Chariot Command Speeder","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Unlike the heavy-hitting troop-carrying AT-AT, the AT-ACT was designed to haul munitions and materiel in support of military operations. Used by both the Imperial Army’s corps of engineers and the Imperial Navy’s logistics corps, these massive cargo-carrying walkers are typically deployed at shipyards and major Imperial military construction sites throughout the galaxy.\n[P]Like the combat-oriented AT-AT, the AT-ACT features a spacious, heavily armored slab of a hull supported by four multi-jointed legs with broad, round feet. The walker’s command deck is mounted on the end of an articulated neck and contains a cramped two-position cockpit as well as its weapon systems. Taking the place of the AT-AT’s troop compartment and small speeder bike hangar is a capacious, two-decked cargo hold. Equipped with a sophisticated cargo-handling and inventory system, the AT-ACT can load or unload immense amounts of materiel in a matter of minutes. To keep that materiel safe, the walker features armor that can shrug off nearly anything short of an anti-armor missile or a direct hit from a turbolaser.

The aerospike engines provide primary thrust, while the ramjets provide short burst of boost and power the multitude of attitude jets scattered around the racers's hull.

Produced for the GAR by Rothana Heavy Engineering, the Saber was designed to provide fire support for infantry formations and to engage light enemy armor. Remarkably quick and nimble for an armored fighting vehicle, the TX-130 was sometimes compared to the Delta-7 [I]Aethersprite[i]-class starfighter due to its ability to get quickly into a fight, hit hard, and escape without a scratch. GAR and Jedi commanders used these fast little tanks to frightening effect during the Clone Wars, and more than one clone trooper unit was saved by the timely arrival of a squadron.\n[P][I]Saber[i] fighter tanks mount a versatile mix of energy weapons and ordnance launchers, which gives their commanders quite a bit of tactical flexibility. Their primary weapons are a pair of fire-linked heavy laser cannons mounted to the tank 's hull. Although they have a fixed-forward firing arc, they can easily be brought to bear on any target, thanks to the [I]Saber[i]'s agility. A smaller support weapon-either a twin medium laser cannon or a powerful Taim & Bak beam cannon-is mounted in a turret atop the vehicle, and rapid-fire ordnance launchers are mounted in each of the tank's sponsons for anti-armor and anti-fortification work. To ensure their survivability in combat, [I]Sabers[i] are covered in lightweight ablative armor, which can shrug off most lighter anti-vehicle weapons, and have a quick-cycling shield generator.\n[P]The [I]Saber[i]'s mix of speed and firepower made it extremely popular among tank crews and clone troopers throughout the Clone Wars. Many of there tanks are still in service today, in the Imperial Army, various Rebel cells, and even some mercenary companies. As is the case with many old Gar fighting vehicles. TX-130s are in high demand among Rebel commanders, and the Alliance is always looking to expand its inventory of both operational tanks and salvage hulls.\n[H4]Taim & Bak KB-50A Beam Cannon[h4]\nSome Sabers were equipped with beam cannon turrets in place of the standard twin medium laser cannons. Beam cannons are specially tuned laser weapons with a high output and long dwell time. They fire continuous beams of energy at a target for roughly three seconds, and then require a few seconds to recharge before firing again. These weapons hit incredibly hard, can punch through light and medium armor with ease, and have a nasty tendency to set targets on fire.\n[P]Sabers equipped with KB-50a beam cannons are used in heavy support roles, providing cover fire for more lightly armed Saber platoons and squads of infantry during advances and assaults.\n[P]A turret-mounted KB-50a Beam Cannon has the following profile: (Fire Arc All; Damage 7; Critical 3: Range (Medium); Breach 2, Burn 2, Slow-Firing 2, Vicious 1).[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 54 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":17,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Medium","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":85000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"TX-130 Saber-class Fighter Tank","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

The wheels offer excellent traction in the fine dust of most lunar surfaces (which often causes venting and overheating problems for landspeeders), and the independent suspension of each wheel enables the Dustcrawler to traverse any manner of difficult terrain.\n[P]The Dustcrawler can be customized for either cargo-hauling or personnel transport.

Once a mainstay of the Grand Army of the Republic, the AT-RT was produced by the thousands during the Clone Wars, and used to great effect by the Advanced Recon Force. Each is just over three meters tall, with a basic form and leg geometry similar to those of the Imperial Army's AT-ST or the old AT-PTs from Rothana Heavy Engineering. The driver sits exposed in an open cockpit behind an armored fairing, and operates the vehicle with hand and foot controls similar to those found on most speeder bikes. While this open-cockpit configuration makes the pilot vulnerable to incoming fire. It provides an unparalleled field of view and keeps the vehicle's weight and sensor signature low, thus improving overall survivability.\n[P]During the Clone Wars, the AT-RT was typically piloted by specifically trained recon clone troopers and deployed in squads of five to ten vehicles. It was used mainly as a scout or raiding vehicle, but some did duty as a pathfinder as well as a picket for larger armored columns or forward bases. Although not a frontline combat unit, the AT-RT packs a respectable punch from a heavy repeating blaster mounted in the vehicle's nose.

This six-legged walker’s profile is dominated by a mass-driver cannon, mounted top and forward, and projecting from a swiveling arm or pod where the gunner sits. This fearsome weapon of war fires slowly but devastatingly,\nlaunching fist-sized projectiles that plow through light\nshields and arm or as easily as open air. Supplementing this main weapon are a half-dozen blaster cannons for anti-personnel purposes, ball-mounted on\nthe front and rear of the walker. The one weakness\nof the AT-TE is its lightly armored underbelly, where a\ndirect hit can have devastating consequences on the\nlegs’ drive system.\n[P]The AT-TE was first used in the Clone Wars as an assault and support vehicle that carried a platoon of clone troopers into battle and provided covering fire,\nespecially against large targets. Over time, the AT-TE\nproved itself a versatile weapon in any arsenal. Its magnetic feet and pressurized interior mean that AT-TEs  can be deployed even in the vacuum of space clinging to asteroids or sheer surfaces to mete out punishment from various vantage points.\n[P]In the years following the Clone\nWars, the Empire has gradually replaced\nthe AT-TE with the larger, more durable AT-AT,\nbanishing its remaining AT-TE walkers to backwater worlds and logistical roles away from front-line\ncombat. Their wide range of possible uses, and\nthe massive numbers that were manufactured\nfor the Clone Wars, make the AT-TE an appealing\nchoice for cash-strapped forces.\n[P]As such, a few AT-TEs are still in\nservice in various roles. Some have\nbeen refitted entirely for civilian use,\nwhile others are kept in com bat condition\nby mercenary forces and others who\nmanaged to acquire them—legally or\notherwise—in the twilight of the\nClone Wars.\n[BR][H4]Additional Rules[h4]\n[B]Dynamic Actuator Pistons:[b] Unlike an AT-At, an AT-TE's wide stance and low center of mass allow it to operate with one or more legs damaged, as this is a real risk of most combat drops. As a result, AT-TE pilots have been known to intentionally collide with enemy craft, counting on their machine's powerful actuator pistons and thick hull plating to compensate for even the most devastating impacts. Reduce any Critical Hit an AT-TE would suffer due to collisions by 30 to a minimum of 1.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 57 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":1,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":40,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":35,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":20,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":40,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":100000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":4,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"All Terrain Tactical Enforcer","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Mass-Driver Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Mass-Driver Cannon[h3][P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 57 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"hardpoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"uxlR4gKZzxKvzeN1","name":"Breach Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"Weapons with Breach burn through the toughest armor, and are often heavy weapons or starship weapons.\n\n[P]Breach weapons ignore one point of Armor for every rating of Breach (meaning they also ignore 10 points of soak for every rating of Breach).","attributes":{},"itemmodifier":[],"adjusteditemmodifer":[],"type":"weapon","rank":2},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"BREACH"}},"id":"fytwqliazurio7c4"},{"_id":"3DLuR2n2AYWRO85z","name":"Slow-Firing Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"Slow-Firing weapons tend to be large, heavy, emplacement-mounted weapons like the turbolasers found on capital ships, or planetary defense ion cannons.

Slow and tough, these walkers are fielded by the Imperial Army as mobile heavy air defense vehicles. A rarity among walker designs, the AT-AA is long and low to the ground, with four short legs ending in three-toed feet that extend out from the sides of the hull rather than straight down like an AT-AT or AT-ST This gives the walker a lizard-like, rather than mammal-like gait and appearance.

In its role as an air defense walker, the AT-AA is armed with either a turret-mounted twin flak cannon or a turret-mounted quad concussion missile battery. This armament, combined with the vehicle's sophisticated air defense targeting system, allows a squad of AT-AAs to deny a remarkably broad swath of sky to enemy airspeeders and starships. While they can keep entire squadrons at bay with their flak bursts and concussion missiles, AT-AAs lack any secondary armaments and thus are woefully susceptible to attack from ground vehicles and infantry. While the walkers are equipped with firing ports from which the crew can fire their personal weapons, the vehicles have few defenses against a determined ground-based enemy.

Slow and tough, these walkers are fielded by the Imperial Army as mobile heavy air defense vehicles. A rarity among walker designs, the AT-AA is long and low to the ground, with four short legs ending in three-toed feet that extend out from the sides of the hull rather than straight down like an AT-AT or AT-ST This gives the walker a lizard-like, rather than mammal-like gait and appearance. These walkers are operated by a crew of three-pilot, gunner, and commander-housed in a cramped forward-mounted control pod. The rest of the vehicle is given over to the power, drive, and fire-control systems. \n\n[P]Heavily armored for a walker of its size, the AT-AA is a slow, plodding vehicle better suited to rear-echelon, over the horizon artillery support and air defense rather than front line combat. In its role as an air defense walker, the AT-AA is armed with either a turret-mounted twin flak cannon or a turret-mounted quad concussion missile battery. This armament, combined with the vehicle's sophisticated air defense targeting system, allows a squad of AT-AAs to deny a remarkably broad swath of sky to enemy airspeeders and starships. While they can keep entire squadrons at bay with their flak bursts and concussion missiles, AT-AAs lack any secondary armaments and thus are woefully susceptible to attack from ground vehicles and infantry. While the walkers are equipped with firing ports from which the crew can fire their personal weapons, the vehicles have few defenses against a determined ground-based enemy.

The cargo compartment is capacious and features a number of tie-downs, latches, and other cargo management apparatuses that keep the cargo safe and secure. When not hauling cargo, fold-out benches in the cargo hold can be deployed to carry up to twenty-five sentients, albeit in cramped and uncomfortable conditions.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":1,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":25,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":220,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":10000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":2,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Trast A-A5 Heavy Speeder Truck","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"AA5SPEEDERTRUCK"}},"_id":"ibhQJdl0DorsmTBq"}

Deployed either in tandem for long range reconnaissance or in squadrons when supporting troops or armor, the AT-ST consists of a lightly armored, slab-sided command pod set atop a pair of thin reverse-articulated legs. The command pod can rotate through 180 degrees, allowing the walker to bring its weapons quickly to bear without having to change the position of its legs, an extremely useful feature when fighting in rough or broken terrain. They are armed with a versatile mix of blasters and ordnance, and can fill both antipersonnel and light anti-armor roles with ease. While certainly capable, AT-STs have a reputation as relatively fragile, high-maintenance vehicles.

These are among the fastest, most powerful airbreathing turbine engines used in Podracing. they are also perhaps, the most fragile and dangerous to run thanks to their extremely volatile tradium fuel. Using a patented quold runium pressurization system and mixed with an ionized injectrine booster, the Split-X features performance capabilities well beyond anything else in its class. Unfortunately, the tradium fuel is so caustic and prone to spontaneous combustion that the engines wear out quickly, and they must be torn completely down and rebuilt more often than other comparable engines.\n[P]Control avionics are provided by a licensed Invom Mk. IV Starweaver flight control suite, typically found on combat airspeeders. Equipped with a comprehensive system of maneuvering jets and advanced variable control surfaces, the Mammoth is remarkably easy to fly.

Maulers are popular in the Outer Rim. In addition to law enforcement, they are also used as search and rescue vehicles, heavy pursuit, and even as cargo lifters if need be.

The massive repulsorlift drives, necessary to keep the unlikely craft aloft, take up the full bottom level. Other facilities include a large galley, heating and cooling units, and storage for supplies and tools occupy the center level. The topmost level of the craft, along with the vessel's open roof, are devoted to the daily lives of those aboard. Quarters for crew, staff, and residents or guests are accompanied by a lounge equipped with dejarik boards, a bar, and other luxuries. The layout of the upper levels is easily reconfigurable, to better suit the comfort of those aboard.

Designed both to carry full platoons of Imperial soldiers with their combat gear and to demoralize and strike terror into enemy combatants, AT-ATs are massive, lumbering, quadruped walkers covered in near-impregnable armor and armed with an array of heavy lasers and blaster cannons. They have four spindly yet incredibly strong legs atop of which perches a hump-backed cargo compartment that holds the embarked troops as well as a quartet of speeder bikes. A massive armored pilot compartment projects forward from the cargo compartment at the end of a short, articulated armored tunnel, adding to the vehicle's animal-like appearance. \n\n[P]In combat, AT-ATs plod forward in a seemingly unstoppable group, softening up targets at range with their weapons and preparing the field for the deployment of their troops. Once they reach their target, the troops disembark via cables deployed from the port side hatch and take to the field. Once their troops are deployed, they typically hold their ground, providing fire support and weathering enemy fire with their powerful armor. Thanks to their sophisticated sensors and command and control systems, AT-ATs are also often used as mobile command centers, allowing a high-ranking general officer to lead his men from the front in relative safety. They have few weak spots, although they have shown a disturbing tendency to lose their footing on unstable ground or if they become entangled in an obstacle.

From the front, the speeder looks like a small starfighter, with a forward hull section that resembles a smaller, narrower Y-wing cockpit. A small, well-appointed, two-seat cockpit is located in the middle of the vehicle, and the vehicle's aft section is dominated by razor-thin control surfaces and two massive ion thrusters in streamlined outboard nacelles.

Also known as the Voltec KT9 Wasp amongst serious racing enthusiasts, it is a competent, well-designed racer that is neither the fastest nor the most agile in its class. Aggressively average, this Podracer sits squarely in the middle of its contemporaries, offering a good, solid racer with few advanced features at a competitive price. It is powered by a pair of huge KVT Series 400 high-thrust fanjets mounted to a small but well-equpped Podracer cockpit by the usual control cables. The engines provide ample thrust and are equipped with a sophisticated control system that allows the pilot to fine-tune their output on the fly.\n[P]Despite its—perhaps unfair—reputation as a staid and boring Podracer for pilots at the end of their career, the 9T9-B does offer one rare and highly sought after feature—its reliability. The Wasp is an amazingly dependable and user friendly Podracer. It is easy to maintain and has a deep and varied aftermarket of performance modifications. In addition, the vehicle was designed around a modular hull and can be modified further than most racers in its class.

Deployed to occupied worlds throughout the Empire, these walkers are used principally to defend important Imperial assets such as military facilities, shipyards, distribution centers, and vital infrastructure. On worlds plagued with unrest or high rebellious activity, the AT-DP is used for patrol and policing where its speed, agility, and firepower can be put to good use.\n[P]Like its AT-ST cousin, the AT-DP is a tall, awkward-looking vehicle consisting of an armored hull perched atop two birdlike legs.

Broad, round feet keep these walkers stable on broken ground and in hilly or mountainous environments. The tandem cockpit is tight but well laid out to improve the efficiency and combat effectiveness of the two-person crew. Lightweight armor and the angled hull provide respectable protection against small arms and even light anti-vehicle weapons while maintaining the walker’s speed and maneuverability.

The Scout-class tank has a very similar silhouette, with a triangular cockpit in a roughly square\nchassis, with pointed \"wings” swooping forward on\neither side. Like its predecessor, the Scout-class is\nequipped with a shield generator for unprecedented\nbeam defense in a ground based craft, but the SC-2M\ncuts back on the heavy armament of the Saber-class.\nInstead, the Scout-class clears room for a third passenger and a variety of possible advanced sensors,\nalthough none of them come standard in the vehicle.\nIts stripped-down weapons loadout still brings a\nfrightening amount of power to the battleheld. When\nfiring in salvo mode, its twin blaster cannons can tear\ninto even heavy targets with a terrifying barrage.\n[P]In terms of mission duty, the SC2-M plays a similar role to that of the venerable AT-ST walker, but its\nrepulsor drive and ray shielding make it a faster and\nmore aggressive craft, ideal for hit-and-run tactics. It is\nresilient against the weapons most troops carry, and\nits high maneuverability makes it difficult for heavier\nassault craft to pin it down. Despite the various costcutting simplifications unique to the Scout-class, it suffers from the same problems as many other repulsor tanks: long, expensive periods of maintenance in between tours of duty and infamously temperamental electronics systems.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 60 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":4,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":25,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":65000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"SC2-M Repulsor Tank","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Blaster Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Blaster Cannon[h3]\n\nKnown colloquially as \"flash cannons,\" blaster cannons are heavy, crew-served versions of the common personal blaster.
