It is designed for fast deployment to poorly scouted sections of Known Space, Wild Space, and the Unknown Regions. It is the size of a light freighter and carries a crew of three to twelve, depending on the mission. The ship carries a complement of six probe droids of various types. Two of the droids can be deployed in space with a hyperspace pod for a pre-programmed return trip. The pods can also be used for transporting messages, as the ship does not carry a HoloNet transceiver. Ten scout troopers are on board, along with their speeder bikes. The Deep Dark is shielded but lightly armed. It is more likely to run than fight when outnumbered or outgunned. \n\n[P]The Skywatcher class is fast and extraordinarily reliable. It has an austere interior that drives users to provide decoration of their own, or at least seek out better accommodations when returning from long trips.

Most of the familiar design cues are there—the spherical cockpit, the solar collectors in the wings, the twin SFS ion engines, but beneath the relatively familiar skin is a completely different fighter than what has come before. Designed to counter the wave of new and extremely competent Alliance fighters, such as the indomitable X-wing and the hard to kill B-wing, the TIE/d was built from the ground up to be a competent and durable multi-role fightercraft. Unlike its simpler, ostensibly disposable cousins, the TIE/d is heavily armored, shielded, and even equipped with a hyperdrive. Its pilots are the cream of the crop, high-ranking ace pilots culled from interceptor squadrons who have survived multiple sorties against the Alliance and who have proven themselves loyal to the Emperor beyond a shadow of a doubt. \n\n[P]As a multi-role fighter, the defender carries a broad mix of weapons, from long range laser cannons to blasters to ordnance launchers, all of which allow it to excel in both fighter combat and attack roles. In their short career in the Imperial Navy, TIE defenders have proven to be highly effective, albeit frightfully expensive in raw unit cost, training time, and maintenance, and are referred to as \"X-wing Killers\" among their pilots and crews.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":300000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"TIE-D \"Defender\" Multi-Role Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Slightly larger than a heavy starfighter, the Sleuth is a small, elegant craft. Long and narrow, the ship has a distinct wasp-waisted silhouette with an angular, forward command deck/cockpit, a narrow midships section mounting a small pair of canards that support the ship's sensor and communications array, and a broad aft section that flares out in a flat triangular shape that houses the engines, winglets, stabilizers, and weapons. The command deck/cockpit section can be charitably described as intimate. The cramped confines of the pilot's station are offset by the panoramic sheets of transparisteel that enclose the cockpit. These thick panes are photosensitive and grant the pilot a nearly unobstructed view of his surroundings. Aft of the pilot's chair, there is a machine closet that can house an astromech droid if so desired. \n\n[P]For scouting and reconnaissance, the Sleuth is equipped with a powerful multirole sensor suite produced by Fabritech for Incom. Tuned for long-range scouting, these sensors use optical and electronic enhancers, as well as active and passive systems like dedicated energy receptors, full-spectrum transceivers, and life-form scanners, to give the scout pilot a comprehensive view of his surroundings. The ship's other systems include a trio of Incom's high-output 804.d Starslinger ion drives, two Taim & Bak IX4 linked laser cannons, and a dependable hyperdrive and navicomputer for long scouting missions. While there are newer scout ships on the market, the A-24 remains popular for its speed and ease of use.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":45000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"A-24 Sleuth-class Scout Ship","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Consisting of a spherical, lightly armored command module with a large circular transparisteel viewport attached to two massive hexagonal wing and solar panel assemblies, the TIE fighter has no shields, no landing gear, no hyperdrive, few computerized systems, and no life support system, requiring the pilots to wear vacuum suits. Every bit of fat was trimmed from the initial design, resulting in a blisteringly fast and shockingly agile ship, albeit one with a high attrition rate. \n\n[P]Along with being light, the ship is also incredibly simple. It draws its power from a miniature version of SFS's I-a2b solar ionization reactor, which collects solar energy from the panels in the fighter's wing assemblies. This generator powers the twinned, high-output SFS P-s4 ion engines from which the craft takes its name, as well as the twin linked laser cannons under the cockpit. TIE fighters are necessarily short-range fighters. When not based at planetary or orbital naval installations, they must be carried into battle by carrier ships such as Star Destroyers or escort frigates.","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":5,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":4,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":50000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":4,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"TIE/LN Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

The single-seat Starchaser has a flat, lifting body fuselage with a broad diamond-shaped nose and short, straight s-foils mounted well aft on port and starboard wing roots. Four H-K Model 4Yb ion fusion engines provide enormous amounts of thrust but little in the way of maneuverability, and the fighters are equipped from the factory with class 2 hyperdrives and relatively sophisticated navicomputers. Standard R-41 armament consists of a pair of wingtip-mounted light laser cannons, forward-mounted light ion cannons, and a single forward-mounted concussion missile launcher which gives the little fighter good anti-ship and anti-armor capabilities. Although the Starchaser showed great promise and performed well against its Z-95 competitor, a number of real or perceived problems with the series limited its broader appeal. \n\n[P]Unfortunately, in an effort to wring every ounce of thrust out of the 4Yb ion engines, Starchasers were lightly armored and had exceptionally fragile hulls with a tendency to disintegrate under moderately heavy fire. Combined with their average maneuverability and low-powered shields, Starchasers were considered deathtraps by most who flew them. In addition, production delays caused them to come to market much later than the Headhunter, providing that fighter with a head start in sales and good first impressions. Combined with the violence of the Clone Wars and the turmoil surrounding the fall of the Galactic Republic, the Starchaser never caught on as a mass market fighter. Already woefully outdated by the time the Empire came to power, H-K discontinued the ill-fated R-41 and relegated it to history. Today, occasional Starchaser squadrons operate within the Rebel Alliance, especially with cash-strapped cells that can't afford to operate Y-wings or X-wings.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":55000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"R-41 Starchaser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Originally built as a deep-space exploration vessel more than two centuries ago, these ships were quite well regarded in their time. Equipped with efficient engines, strong shields, long-range sensors, automated maintenance and resource-recycling systems, and deep cargo holds to carry provisions, the VG-4210 series ships could stay operational in deep space for months or even years at a time without refit or resupply. In the years since they first came on the market, these stalwart old ships have been supplanted by better, more modern, and more powerful ships. Most of those that weren't lost in space or to simple fatigue were scrapped and their hulls and systems recycled for their base materials. \n\n[P]A few survived, however, passing from owner to owner, until their original scouting role gave way to that of a humble light freighter. Now, those few YG-4210s still active serve small-time traders and smugglers in the Outer Rim. Perfect for the newly formed or budget-minded mercantile concern, these ships are still quite useful after all these generations in space, and many can even keep up with the latest offerings from CEC, Incom, and TransGalMeg. \n[P]The YG-4210 is, like all of the ancient YG-series ships, unlike anything Corellian Engineering has on the market today. It has a flat, single-decked, spade-shaped hull with a dorsally mounted command deck covered by an armored blister canopy. It has three subspace engines located in the trefoil-shaped engineering section that is connected to the main hull by a small passage.

The interior of the SS-54 is largely open, with room enough for a squad of troops or a handful of passengers to ride in relative comfort. Standard armament consists of four fire-linked laser cannons mounted forward in the prow and a twin light laser turret mounted dorsally just aft of the engine spars.\n[P]Since its introduction, the SS-54 has gained a small but loyal following among mercenaries and bounty hunters.Among its users, this ship has a reputation as a simple, reliable, and versatile vessel that can fill a number of roles remarkably well.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 58 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":18,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":30,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":110000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"SS-54 Light Assault Gunship","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

{"name":"YV-666 Light Freighter","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]YV-666 Light Freighter[h3]\nSlab-sided and imposing, Corellian Engineering Corporation's YV-666 light freighter is a radical departure from the company's traditional styling principles. Introduced decades ago, these large, square-shouldered ships have steadily gained a reputation as fast, durable, easy to fly freighters that withstand incredible amounts of hard usage. Designed initially as long-range haulers, the YV-666 carries a surprising amount of cargo in its modular, environmentally sealed cargo holds. Thanks to their considerable fuel tanks and capacious holds, these ships are often the best, most efficient way to ship goods to the far reaches of the galaxy.\n[P]Roughly twice the size of CEC's popular YT-series freighters, the YV-666 pushes the boundaries of what is normally considered a light freighter. It has a tall, narrow, vaguely trapezoidal hull with three interior decks and no visible viewports. A long, reinforced fantail extends the keel from the lowest deck, and is home to the ship's Quadex SuperNova II power core, a pair of high-output CEC Evader-GT ion drives, repulsorlift systems, and two broad, variable-pitch, swept wings with downward-cranked tips. The ship's small flight deck is located in the far-forward compartment of the top deck, and features a unique windowless cockpit that uses high-resolution holo-projectors to give the pilot a 180-degree view of his surroundings. While they are not designed for front line combat, these ships do mount a pair of light lasers in a forward mount and a retractable quad laser turret for defensive purposes.\n[P]Like other CEC offerings, the YV-666 is a reliable and versatile ship designed with an eye toward end-user customization. The ship's three-decked hull, an excess of redundant systems connections, and a robust aftermarket make it quite popular with medium and heavy haulers throughout the galaxy.\n[P]In addition, these ships have garnered a small but dedicated following among the galaxy's bounty hunters, who find the YV-666's modular design, roomy compartments, and rugged hull a perfect fit for their dangerous line of work. Perhaps the most famous is the [I]Hound's Tooth[i], a highly modified YV-666 owned by the Trandoshan bounty hunter Bossk.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 62 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":30,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":200,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":132000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"YV-666 Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Quad Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Quad Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nQuad lasers are dedicated anti-starfighter-weapons consisting of four small-caliber laser cannons linked to a single firing mechanism and slaved to a sophisticated fire-control system.

Eventually, even the most disadvantaged systems replaced their Torrents with more modern fighters, and these beautiful ships were left behind. However, some enterprising aftermarket corporations refurbished the fighters, removing their weapon systems and upgrading their navicomputers and sensor suites, and marketed them as fast, inexpensive courier ships.\n[P]With its forward-percherd, for-and-after cockpit, the V-19b's distinctive thin hull is often perceived as cramped, even without the two passengers the official manifests claim it can hold. Emergency gear, rations, and very limited storage space occupy the oddly shaped spaces in and around the turbine engines housed in a flaring cowl at the rear of the ship. Its thick, short wings (more vanes housing its repulsor lift generators than actual control surfaces) contributed to the ship's nickname as well as its reputation for poor handling in thicker atmospheres.\n[P]When one is searching for a means of transportation that will be able to penetrate a hostile system, anything from a tense border situation to an active war zone, the V-19b Dart is a perfect choice. With the handling and armor of a fighter, this ship will be able to withstand nearly anything the galaxy can throw at it, delivering its crew with a minimum of fuss.

The second, and even more evident, was that the Navy needed a starfighter more capable and powerful by far than the standard TIE/In to counter the Rebellion's powerful X-wings. The first problem was dealt with relatively easily through changes in organization and deployment of Imperial forces, and the second was dealt with by the development of the TIE/hu hunter. \n\n[P]A combination of the best parts of the TIE/In, TIE/in, and TIE/ad, the TIE hunter is the first truly multi-role starfighter to enter service with the Imperial Navy. Using data collected over the course of countless encounters with Alliance starfighters, Seinar Fleet Systems designed an all-new fighter with more robust internal systems, shields, and life support. The TIE hunter also boasts a hyperdrive and a versatile loadout of energy weapons and ordnance launchers. After initial field testing showed an extremely promising fighter, the Admiralty decided to issue the deadly new fighters to the Imperial Storm Commandos. \n\n[P]At first glance, TIE hunters bear a striking resemblance to TIE interceptors. They have four dagger-shaped solar collector wings tipped with laser can-nons and the iconic TIE-series spherical command pod. Further inspection shows that the solar collectors are, in fact, variable geometry s-foils nearly identical to those found on the X-wing. Armed with four linked medium laser cannons, a pair of ion cannons, and two proton torpedo launchers, the hunter is easily a match for any fighter in the Alliance inventory, including the X-wing. Thankfully, for the Alliance at least, production of the TIE hunter is still in its infancy, and building squadrons up to strength is taking longer than the Imperial Navy brass would like.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":5,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":9,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":253000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"TIE/HU \"Hunter\" Multi-Role Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Ion Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Ion Cannon[h3]\n\nIon weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets.

A purpose-built smuggling vessel, the YG-4400 is a small, stocky ship with a blocky body and three bulky engines aft. The powerful engines provide impressive straight-line speed, at the cost of maneuverability. However, this is part of the YG-4400's overall design. \n\n[P]Between the three engines, CEC's engineers nestled a \"getaway\" concussion missile launcher. When the YG-4400 makes a run for it, any ships in pursuit find themselves taking point-blank missile-fire. This tends to discourage even the most die-hard customs enforcers. \n\n[P]Law enforcement officials have long tried to gain injunctions to stop CEC from producing the YG-4400. Of course, megacorporations as powerful as CEC can usually laugh off these legal maneuverings, and CEC keeps full time staff in Coronet simply to deal with such attempts.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Suns of Fortune[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":21,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":75,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":110000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"YG-4400 Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Concussion Missile Launcher","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Concussion Missile Launcher[h3]\n\nThe more common and less powerful of the two types of shipboard ordnance, concussion missiles are found on all manner of spacecraft, from tiny starfighters to capital ships.

While they enjoyed modest success, and were highly praised for their performance and ease of operation, the Hawk-290s never reached the sales numbers of the more popular VT-series, and the entire line was discontinued during the Clone Wars to free up production lines for military use. \n\n[P]The Hawk-290 is a light, fast, agile craft designed for speed and comfort rather than heavy lifting. They are handsome vessels with lean, angular hulls and narrow, deeply tinted viewports that make them look fast and aggressive, even when parked in a hangar. While they were never designed to carry much cargo, the HWK-series still has a respectable lift capacity for vessels of their size, and are well suited for courier work and the transportation of small, highly valuable cargoes. They have light armor and were originally designed with no weapon systems, relying instead on raw speed and maneuverability for protection. Of course, being CEC products, they are incredibly versatile and modular, and most Hawks still plying the spacelanes are so heavily modified as to be nearly unrecognizable.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Far Horizons[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":18,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":18,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":75,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":70000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"HWK-290 Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"HWK290LTFREIGHT"}},"_id":"6c1sbptegDwlvSeL"}

Designed with heavy space combat and planetary occupation in mind, these powerful ships serve both the Imperial and Rebel Alliance Navies as workhorse cruisers. They fill a number of roles and are typically employed in missions that larger vessels cannot or will not undertake. They mount a strong mix of weapon systems and can carry a single squadron of starfighters in a dedicated hangar, a feature that is extremely attractive to the Rebel Alliance, whose commanders rely so much on fighter tactics. Although once quite common, Dreadnoughts are becoming increasingly rare as they succumb to fatigue, accident, combat, and parts scarcity. With their large crew requirement and antiquated systems, Dreadnoughts are often simply left to deteriorate in shipyards or in orbit above planets when they break down, as the Empire considers them not worth the price of repair. This doesn't stop the Alliance from salvaging and refitting them, however, and many a former Imperial Dreadnought has found a new and loving home in the Alliance fleet.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":100,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":40,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":3000,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":7500,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":7200000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Dreadnought-Class Heavy Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Built in great numbers by Kuat Systems Engineering, the Alpha-3 Nimbus, also known as the V-wing, entered service with the Republic Navy late in the Clone Wars to replace the aging Delta-series interceptors. Faster and lighter than the heavy ARC-170 fighters, Republic Navy V-wings were not only incredibly fast and agile but also remarkably sturdy for such small, lightweight fighters. Similar in appearance and performance to KSE's Delta-7 Aethersprite interceptor, the V-wing has a broad, wedge-shaped hull with a single-position cockpit located far aft on the ship's dorsal side. Blade-shaped, variable geometry wings are mounted on rotating port and starboard hubs just aft of the cockpit, and provides the fighter, along with its advanced vectored thrust system with its impressive maneuverability. While the V-wing has no native hyperspace capabilities, it does feature an astromech droid, the unique Q7 series, to monitor systems and perform light maintenance during flight. \n\n[P]Although very lightly armored, V-wing interceptors are remarkably sturdy fighters with strong hulls and well-designed power systems that can take inordinate amounts of abuse. Powered by a pair of early model KSE high-output ion engines in an over/under configuration, V-wings are nearly as fast and agile as a modern TIE-series fighter. V-wings served with the Republic Navy until the end of the Clone Wars, and then with the infant Imperial Navy at the beginning of the Empire's rise to power. Soon, however, the first TIE-series fighters were introduced and the entire fleet of V-wings was either scrapped or sold out of the service as surplus.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":70000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Alpha-3 Nimbus \"V-Wing\" Interceptor","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Much like planetside recovery service craft, the L-2783 can travel to  a remote site to repair, or recover a damaged starship, sometimes as salvage. Based on a bulk cargo capital ship, the cavernous cargo hold of the L-2783 is capable of containing and carrying ships and debris up to the size of an old-style cruiser. Powerful tractor beams pull in ships or wreckage as needed. and the hold can be partitioned off by enormous force fields. The tractor beam can tow smaller craft at sublight speeds.\n[P]A small fleet of twin seated scavenger pods operate from an aft-facing hanger bay. The pods are armed with plasma cutters and clamps, enabling them to retrieve smaller objects and deposit them into L-2783's pair of large dorsal holds. An array of repair shops and supply vaults allow the ship to make repairs to other craft vessel when needed. The L-2783 comes standard with minimal weaponry, but its strong shields protect it from pirates and aggressive scavengers. A regular crew can reach into the hundreds, though it can operate with a skeleton crew of twenty-five.\n[P]Over the years, many scavengers have converted the L-2783 to be full-time salvage craft, making their living by harvesting materials from wrecks new and old. A few Outer Rim crime lords and mercenary groups have refitted these vessels as small carriers, which also requires substantial upgrades to weaponry and shielding. Pirates occasionally use ships of this model to waylay and abscond with entire freighters, using the pods as makeshift assault craft, though they are easy targets for any serious military vessel. A few true entrepreneurs use L-2783s as massive mobile repair centers, regularly servicing orbital space stations and deep space outposts, and even carrying out in-flight repairs.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 64 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-4,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":55,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":35,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":100,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":6500000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"L-2783 Deep Space Recovery Vessel","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

{"name":"BTS-A2 \"H-Wing\" Long-Range Strike Starfighter","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]BTS-A2 \"H-Wing\" Long-Range Strike Starfighter[h3]\n\nA follow-up to Koensayr's wildly successful Y-wing starfighter, the BTS-A2 H-wing is a heavily armed and armored, three-man fighter designed for long-range strike and interdiction missions. Essentially an up-armored and up-gunned Y-wing equipped with modern avionics and fire control systems, the H-wing is a steady, reliable fighter that can punch well above its weight thanks to a broad collection of ordnance and energy weapons. Taking the lessons learned from the production and long life of the venerable Y-wing, the H-wing's hull is a broad, lifting body design with a unique tandem-style cockpit. The port cockpit houses the ship's pilot, while the starboard cockpit houses the two weapon systems operators responsible for the fighter's onboard weap-ons. In addition, a tiny. cramped compartment with a bunk, chemical refresher, and soundproof divider is located aft of the cockpits for use by the crew on long-distance hyperspace jumps. Powered by a pair of Koensayr's relatively new R440 Ion Jet Engines fitted with the company's iconic thrust vectral vanes, the H-wing is remarkably fast for such a heavy fighter. Other systems familiar to V-wing pilots and technicians are used in the H-wing, such as an upgraded version of Fabritech's ANx-Y sensor package and the successor to SubPro's NH-7 comprehensive avionics package. \n\n[P]The H-wing is very well-suited to its role as a strike/attack starfighter with its diverse array of armaments. The ship's primary weapon is a dorsal turret-mounted Taim & Bak KY12 medium laser cannon which gives the H-wing excellent anti-ship and anti-armor capabilities. Secondary weapon systems include a linked pair of forward-mounted ArMek light ion cannons and two Arakyd flex tube proton torpedo launchers. This versatile loadout, combined with its powerful shields, reliable systems, sturdy construction, and long-range capabilities, make the H-wing perfect for far-ranging patrols, commerce raiding, and solo cruises. \n\n[P]Although envisioned by Koensayr as a replacement for the aging V-wings in the Rebel arsenal and a heavy-strike counterpart to the new B-wings, widespread use of the H-wing has yet to catch on among the members of the Alliance. While there are a number of reasons to explain the halting adoption of this new fighter, the primary reason is that the H-wing is a large, expensive, and complex new fighter trying to force its way into a niche already filled by two capable and well-liked fighters with established support infrastructure. In addition, very few Rebel installations have the facilities or manpower required to maintain a single H-wing, let alone an entire squadron. As it stands, those few H-wings in Alliance service are used as escorts for freighter-tonvoys and system patrol craft in Rebel-held star systems.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":225000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"BTS-A2 \"H-Wing\" Long-Range Strike Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Used primarily for patrol and interdiction, these ships are commonly put to use chasing down and destroying slavers who prey on Wookiees in and around Kashyyyk’s system. Like most gunships, the [I]Auzituck[i] class (“Auzituck” translates roughly as “liberated one” in Shyriiwook) is a relatively fast, well-armored, heavily armed vessel with a narrow profile, big engines, and an ability to punch well above its weight class. It has a two-position tandem cockpit that houses the pilot in the upper position and the co-pilot/gunner in the lower forward position. Aft of the cockpit is room for up to eight individuals on wall mounted benches for hauling troops or beings rescued from slavery. Two powerful ion drives are mounted outboard on swooping pylons fitted to the aft dorsal section of the hull, and a single boarding hatch is mounted aft.\n[P]In its role as both a patrol boat and antislaver vessel, the [I]Auzituck[i]-class carries a respectable weapons loadout. Two fire-linked medium laser cannons are mounted on either side of the hull beneath the gunner’s canopy, a dorsal turret houses twin medium ion cannons, and a single-tube concussion missile launcher is mounted beneath the vessel’s chin in an armored housing. These weapons give the [I]Auzituck[i]-class good flexibility and the ability to easily disable or destroy the kinds of ships typically used by pirates and slavers, especially when working in groups. Their thick armor and high-output shield generators can shrug off quite a bit of damage, and their sturdy build and redundant systems make them incredibly hard to disable.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 123 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":18,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":95000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Auzituck-class Gunship","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Built to compete against the A-wing, the T-wing is a small, lightweight, short-range, fast response interceptor designed to operate close to its base of operation. With its sharp-edged, angular, wedge-shaped fuselage, the T-wing is an aggressive-looking little ship. Powered by a trio of H-K 5J Mk.11 afterburning ion engines, two mounted at the tips of the short s-foils and one mounted dorsally on a short pylon delivering thrust through an advanced vectoring system, on paper, the T-wing is a match for any Imperial fighter. In reality, however, the T-wing falls just short of the mark in a number of critical categories. \n\n[P]While the T-wing isn't actually dangerous to fly, it suffers from the use of cheap, poor quality components and is plagued with a variety of small but infuriating problems. The fighter's shields are too light for its intended role, and have a worrying tendency to fail under moderate enemy fire. While the T-wing is equipped with a hyperdrive, the T-60's navicomputer software is obsolete and full of coding errors that make navigation more an act of faith than anything else. \n[P]Despite these shortcomings, H-K hasn't slowed production and continues to search for a market for their bargain-basement interceptor. While the leadership of the Rebel Alliance refused to even consider the R-60 for service, a handful of third party operatives in the Outer Rim territories have shown interest in the T-wing, mostly due to its low cost and favorable parts and service packages offered by H-K salesmen.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":6,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":7,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":95000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"R-60 \"T-Wing\" Interceptor","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Using the lessons learned over the decades since the YT-1300's initial launch, CEC's engineers packed as much power and as many sophisticated flight and cargo handling systems into the YT-2400 as it could possibly hold. The YT-2400 has a saucer-shaped hull with a central circular core surrounded by cargo and passenger modules. Like all YT series freighters, it has a starboard-mounted cockpit connected to the main hull by a pair of reinforced pylons. The cockpit section contains its own access hatch and crew escape pod. Overall, these ships are slightly smaller than the YT-1300, thus they make better, more efficient use of the space available to them. The bow of the ship and forward cockpit pylon contain the ship's main cargo hold and the crew quarters. Opposite the cockpit are the common galley and refresher, and abaft the central core are a number of private cabins, the engineering bay, and the passenger escape pod. \n\n[P]While officially built as a civilian freighter to be used for legitimate business, Corellian Engineering's marketing and development departments are fully aware that the majority of their customers are, perhaps, on the far side of the law.

Descended from the Republic Navy’s [I]Arquitens[i] class, which served so well during the Clone Wars, this new ship shares little aside from a class name and basic hull shape with its predecessors. Years ago, as part of a service-life extension program, the newly created Imperial Navy recalled all of the old [I]Arquitens[i]-class ships still on duty to the dry docks at Kuat Drive Yards. These, the ships were given an extensive overhaul, increasing their speed, agility, combat ability, power output, and other systems to bring them more in line with the Imperial Navy’s order of battle. When the new [I]Arquitens[i]-class ships were brought into the Navy officially, they were faster, tougher, and sleeker; hit harder; and could withstand more punishments. Most of this first generation of [I]Arquitens[i]-class ships was scrapped some time ago, victims of attrition, age, and the march of technology. The ships currently in service with the Imperial Navy are all newly built vessels with cutting-edge systems; they are considered a variant of the old [I]Arquitens[i] starship.\n[P]In the Imperial Navy’s order of battle, [I]Arquitens[i] vessels fill a number of roles. Typically, they are stationed at out-of-the-way Imperial worlds to keep the peace and protect Imperial assets. They are also often sent of detached service throughout the Outer Rim, given to trustworthy captains to cruise Imperial space for pirates, resistance vessels, and other dangerous malcontents. These fast and useful cruisers are also found as support ships in larger battlegroups headed by Star Destroyers, battle cruisers, or dreadnoughts. A handful of these useful vessels have even been fitted for electronic warfare, reconnaissance, and armed transport.\n[P][I]Arquitens[i]-class cruisers have a broad, flat, kite-shaped hull with three powerful main engine mounted aft in a horizontal housing. They have a ship docking ring at the port and starboard points of the hull, and a squat, rectangular bridge tower mounted just forward of the engines. The forward third of the ship’s hull is split into two spars, between which lies the small craft launch and recovery systems that house the vessel’s small supply of fighters and shuttles. Two large turbolaser batteries dominate the dorsal side of the hull, and they are matched by another pair on the ventral side. These batteries give the [I]Arquitens[i]-class excellent offensive and defensive capabilities.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 128 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":60,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":45,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":2,"starboard":2,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Medium","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":100,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":1200,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":5000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Arquitens-class Light Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

These fighters are reserved for the finest pilots in the Imperial Navy, as their inherently unstable design and lightning fast agility require an incredible amount of flying prowess to tame. Relatively rare among Imperial fighter squadrons, TIE/in squadrons are typically reserved for front-line battle groups.

They are considered to be mad or suicidal, or probably both, by those with the luxury of a shielded fighter with a reliable hyperdrive, systems that the TIE/in pilots must do without. Their skill as pilots is without question, and the bravery they show entering combat in their extremely fragile and near-uncontrollable fighters engenders grudging respect from even the most hard-line Rebel in the fleet.

Known affectionately as the wishbone by its pilots, the Y-wing consists of a central fuselage section flanked by two drive nacelles mounted to reinforced pylons. The central section houses a heavily armored cockpit with full life support and pilot support systems, as well as all of the ship's weapon systems, with an astromech socket directly abaft. The Novaldex power generator, along with the fighter's shield generator, hyperdrive, and numerous other essential systems, is mounted amidships with engine nacelles on either side. Each contains a powerful Koensayr-produced R200 ion engine. \n\n[P]In keeping with their role as ship killers, Y-wings have thick armor and heavy shields to protect them while they close with targets. With their slim cross-section, sturdy protection, and powerful weapons, they are well suited to a role that requires them to fight their way to a target, deliver their ordnance, and fight their way back. Despite their reputation for reliability, Y-wings possess some quirks that make them relatively high maintenance. This has led to frustrated crews and technicians permanently removing the largely cosmetic hull plating for ease of constant access to the fighter's internal systems; it's a rare Y-wing that flies with its hull plates intact. \n\n[P]The BTL-A4 Y-wing is a single-seat variant, While the BTL-S3 has a second seat for a sensor officer/gunner behind the pilot. In the BTL-S3, the gunner fires the ion cannon turrets, while in the BTL-A4, they are fixed forward and controlled by the pilot.

Almost more starfighter than freighter, the KST-11 entered service towards the end of Clone Wards. A dashing-looking ship by anyone’s standards, the Kestrel has small, saucer-shaped hull reminiscent of CEC’s popular YT-series light freighters. Four powerful ion engines, two to a side, are mounted port and starboard, and a spacious side-by-side cockpit provides the pilot and co-pilot with an unparalleled field of vision through its numerous viewports. Two long forward-mounted booms house sensors, a pair of light laser cannons, and variable geometry winglets to provide stability and maneuverability when flying in atmosphere.\n[P]The main hull is given over almost entirely to passenger facilities. Four small but well-appointed staterooms surround a common galley and lounge. A small engineering station is located along the aft bulkhead, and a single small, cramped crew berth is located beneath the cockpit. Like the HWK-series ships from which they borrowed much inspiration, the Kestrels are fine ships but suffer from limited utility, high price, and a market already crowded with established, well-respected ship classes. The KST-100 was only produced for five years, and the total production was less than one thousand hulls. Most are still operating, mostly as military and governmental transports or as personal starships for wealthy individuals.

Designed and built by TransGalMeg Incorporated, the KLS was commissioned by the powerful Black Sun organization. Since the fighters would be deployed in a number of roles in various environments throughout the galaxy, Black Sun requested a simple, reliable, lightweight, easy to operate ship that could be easily modified to fit roles ranging from escort to interception to space superiority. Under Black Sun's guidance, and with their nearly bottomless coffers providing ample capital, TransGalMeg produced an extremely potent and versatile fighter of a kind nearly unknown in ship building circles.\n[P]The base model Kihraxz bears a striking resemblance to Incom's X-wing and Z-95 fighters. It has a short, narrow fuselage with a single-position cockpit mounted amidships. Two powerful ion engines are slung in nacelles beneath a pair of sharply-angled dorsal-mounted wings located aft of the cockpit, and a pair of smaller canards mounted to the nose provide extra stability. The fighter's primary weapons—a pair of high-output blaster cannons—are mounted at the wingtips, with an ordnance launcher and ion cannon mounted in the starboard and port wings roots respectively. Although lightly armored and fragile, the base ship's loadout, speed, and agility make it a formidable opponent, especially when fielded in large groups.\n[P]The Kihraxz's real strength lies in its modification potential. The ship's primary structures and systems—fuselage, wingbox, weapons systems, drives—are all unit-constructed and designed to be easily installed and removed with basic shipyard facilities. This allows the fighters to be tailored to their user's exact specifications. TransGelMeg sells aftermarket modification kits with significant upgrades to the base platform.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 60 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":7,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":65000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Kihraxz Light Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Blaster Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Blaster Cannon[h3]\n\nKnown colloquially as \"flash cannons,\" blaster cannons are heavy, crew-served versions of the common personal blaster.

With their relatively aerodynamic, lifting body fuselages, CloakShapes were designed as aerospace superiority fighters with an emphasis on atmospheric and near-orbital combat. They are powered by a pair of KSE 807b/9 afterburning ion engines backed up by a light repulsorlift, a setup that gives the fighter respectable speed but marginal agility. They have no hyperdrive and carry no shields; to compensate, CloakShape fighters have reinforced, heavily armored hulls, which makes them incredibly durable. Despite their lackluster performance, short range, and limited scope, CloakShape fighters have soldiered on for decades now thanks to two important features: they are inexpensive and are easily customizable. \n\n[P]It's often said that there's no such thing as a stock Cloak-Shape fighter. The fighter's simple design, modular components, and plethora of universal power and computer couplings make these ships prime candidates for modification. Over the decades, numerous aftermarket systems have been designed and sold for the CloakShape, and their ease of installation and use has allowed these fighters to compete against modern starfighters with some success. The most common are upgraded powerplants, hyperdrives and navicomputers, shield generators, heavier weapons, and more sophisticated communications and sensor systems.

Ungainly-looking ships with a small forward command pod attached to a massive modular container ship hull by a broad, flat, triangular spar, these ships were initially designed to carry heavy, containerized cargoes on long-distance hyperspace trade routes. Acquired by a Rebel operative at auction, the handful of ships that would become the Quasar Fire-class were seen as a quick and relatively easy way to acquire vessels capable of carrying starfighters into battle and supporting them with full service hangars (instead of each individual squadron traveling to an engagement separately, hoping that they all arrive relatively close together). The vessels were flown to a secret Rebel shipyard where they were torn down to the keel, and over the course of many standard months, they were rebuilt as dedicated starfighter carriers. \n[P]Roughly the equivalent of the Imperial Navy's Ton-Falk-class escort carriers in power and fighter capacity, these vessels have improved the efficacy of Alliance fighter operations by leaps and bounds. Extremely valuable to the Rebel cause and jealously guarded by their captains and crews, Quasar Fire-class carriers are always accompanied by a strong mixed battlegroup of gunboats and cruisers to protect the fragile carriers and their precious cargo of starfighters.

It has a broad, flat, rectangular hull with a heavily armored, forward-mounted flight deck. Four long, angular S-foils are mounted port and starboard, two to a side, to give the heavy vessel additional lift and stability in atmosphere. The interior cargo hold is modular and can be configured to carry nearly any sort of materiel needed by the Imperial military. When sealed, the modular cargo hold is shielded against scanners and separated from the ship’s onboard networks, an excellent feature for delicate or top-secret cargoes. These vessels also feature a series of ventral-mounted cargo clamps that can carry containerized cargo. These containers can be dropped onto targets while the ship is still moving; many supply or delivery missions are carried out simply by flying by the landing zone, slowing down to drop the containers, and then flying away to safety.\n[P]While ostensibly a non-combat vessel, the [I]Zeta[i]-class is remarkably heavily armed and armored. A trio of hull-mounted medium lasers makes up the ship’s primary armament. These are backed up by four fire-linked light lasers mounted in the forward pair of S-foils. The ship’s armor is both thick and angled in such a way as to deflect energy blasts, projectiles, and shrapnel. They powerful weapons loadout and sturdy armor more than make up for the shuttles’ slow speed and poor handling, allowing good crews to shrug off or blast through most opposition.\n[P]Since the [I]Zeta[i]-class is relatively new, very few are currently in service with the Imperial Navy.

Designed with planetary exploration in mind, the YV-560 is geared toward providing a stable and reliable platform from which explorers, scholars, and archaeologists can base their remote research. While officially classified as a freighter, they were essentially purposely built to carry small and delicate cargoes, samples, and artifacts of the kind unearthed by scientists and scholars. \n\n[P]The cargo holds aboard the YV-560 series are smaller than those found on other CEC ships. They are compartmentalized and distributed around the ship to provide balance and structural reinforcement to the hull. Each one is isolated from the others and from the ship's general atmosphere, possessing individual atmosphere processors and heating and cooling systems. They are also airtight, lockable, and can be completely sealed and walled off behind bulk-heads in case of an emergency. \n\n[P]The vessels themselves have all the hallmarks of CEC's ship-architecture philosophy. Similar in size and shape to the venerable YT-1000, the YV-560 series has the iconic saucer-shaped hull possessed by most of CEC's light freighters. While they are lightly armed and armored, they have sturdy hulls and can withstand a surprising amount of punishment. The two-position command pod is centrally mounted on the dorsal side of the vessel, and two powerful sensor booms extend forward from the hull, for an appearance slightly reminiscent of the YT-1300's loading mandibles. The interior of the ship is laid out in a similar fashion to other CEC-series ships, with good accommodations for passengers and crew and comfortable, if perhaps a touch limited, common areas, galleys, and heads. \n\n[P]Along with its common monitoring systems, the ship contains a powerful scientific computer designed to aid explorers in scientific pursuits, with a main terminal in the common area and smaller remote terminals in each passenger berth. Along with its regular navigation sensors, the YV-560 is also equipped with a powerful, high-definition, precision planetary-scanning array that allows it to survey a new planet from orbit. While they have only been on the market for a few years, the YV-560s have lived up to their advertising and more than one scientific expedition is based out of these new ships.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":80,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":120000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"YV-560 Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Around the time of the Battle of Yavin, an updated model saw large-scale production.

This design minimizes space for power generation and storage onboard, allowing room for additional systems. The [I]Raider's [i] deadly accurate double laser cannons feature state-of-the-art tracking sensors.

Based on a centuries old Rendili Hyperworks design, these staid, workaday vessels have been in space for decades now. Officially classified by Rendili as “Armed Medium Transports.” Hammerheads are big, bulky ships that were built to transport goods and people safely, comfortably, and without the need to costly escorts. They have a beamy, cylinder-shaped hull that contains a number of large modular cargo holds, external docking ports for cargo containers, and an external cargo lift. The flight deck, the crew berths, and a handful of passenger staterooms are located in the angular, vertical bow, which gives these ships their easily recognizable profile and class name. Three large, pylon-mounted RSD 88D-II BrightStar ion engines dominate the ship’s aft.\n[P]In their intended role as armed transports, Hammerheads carry a respectable armament of two heavy lasers and two light ion cannons mounted in the bow. Remarkably heavily armed for ships of their class and role, they carry sturdy shields to better withstand the vagaries and dangers of space travel. Their internal systems are easy to maintain and upgrade, and they are fitted with numerous redundancies to keep the vessels at peak operating efficiency. While they are considered outmoded today, these sturdy vessels have a well-deserved reputation for toughness and reliability not enjoyed by many newer, more advanced ships. Most notably, tales of their survivability in actual collisions have fashioned legends of Hammerheads performing deliberate rams to disable enemy ships. While often acts of desperation, such actions have forced many an Imperial vessel to disengage from combat and allow resistance ships to escape.\n[P]Most [I]Hammerhead[i]-class ships still in operation are in the hands of small, private shipping concerns that use them in low-risk, short-hop transport roles or as backup for newer and larger ships. Thanks to their easily upgradable systems and their tough hulls, a few have found their way into pirate or smuggling fleets, where they are highly modified with more powerful weapons and better cargo-hauling systems, it is rumored that the resistance has acquired a handful of these ships and is using them to deal surprising damage to the Imperial Navy.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 129 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":50,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":25,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":3,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Medium","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":125,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":1000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Hammerhead-class Corvette","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Unlike its newest cousin, the Action VI, the Action IV is one of the largest star freighters in the Corellian fleet with the capacity for planetary landings, explaining in large part the allure of the old ship in the modern mark. Although there are larger bulk freighters capable of moving more cargo with greater economy, the need for orbital facilities and dedicated landers limits the usefulness of those ships for certain markets and purposes.\n[P]The Action IV's block, utilitarian design bears little resemblance to the more streamlined hull design of the latest Action variants. The cargo bays of the IV are more uniform, and the intervening bulkheads are capable of being removed to create a more versatile cargo space than the two hunched-looking bays of the Anchor VI.

Developed by Republic Sienar Systems from a licensed Incom design, [I]Jadthu[i]-class landers were first acquired by the GAR in the years leading up to the Clone Wars. They were initially classed as short-range heavy strategic lift vessels. The first Jadthus delivered to the GAR were equipped with modular cargo holds and various freight-handling systems. Lacking hyperdrives and navicomputers, they were relegated to in-system hauling and occasional transatmospheric freight delivery. As the Republic geared up for its war against the  Separatists, however, GAR brass ordered a number of modifications to turn the big, sturdy vessels into orbital dropships for the newly deployed clone army.\n[P]In their new role as combat dropships, the [I]Jadthu[i]-class landers underwent a massive combat retrofit. Their blocky, trapezoidal hulls were reinforced to better withstand transatmospheric operations and then covered in thick starship armor that could shrug off even the heaviest weapons. Freight-handling systems were removed, and the Jadthu's cargo holds were modified to carry a mix of troops, equipment, and light vehicles. Power plants and engines were upgraded to military spec, which gave the heavy ships a blistering straight-line speed, and they were equipped with defensive laser turrets and physical countermeasure systems, such as the Arakyd Industries Caltrop-5 Chaff Gun, to protect them from enemy fighters and gunboats. All these modifications made for a ship that could enter the hottest landing zones, deploy its troops, and retreat safely to orbit while under heavy fire.\n[P]After serving for years during the Clone Wars, the [I]Jadthu[i]-class was mothballed by the nascent Imperial Navy in favor of more  modern Sienar Fleet Systems designs. Before they could all be  scrapped, many of these vessels found their way into unauthorized hands as they were stolen from breaking yards or storage docks. Today, the [I]Jadthu[i]-class has found a new home delivering troops for the Rebel Alliance as well as for certain mercenary and criminal organizations.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 60 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":30,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":60,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":800,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":200000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Jadthu-class Landing Ship","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Improvements on the older ship's design included an offset, side-mounted cockpit, more powerful engines, better sensors, and a more efficient cargo handling system. Unfortunately, as is the case with many sophomore efforts, the VT-1200 fell well short of its predecessor in a number of important areas. \n\n[P]In a clear-cut case of trying too hard, CEC designers net out not to build a well-built freighter, but to build \"the next YT-1000.° They looked at market analysis and customer feedback, identified what they believed made the YT-1000 so successful, and designed the new ship to simply do what the YT-1000 did in the hopes of another wild success. Initial sales were very good, but as customers became more familiar with these new ships, complaints came pouring in. The YT-1200 was seen as not enough of its own ship to be really distinguished from the YT-1000. Customers also reported the engines weren't powerful enough, the internal systems were buggy, and the stock power generators were prone to power surges and short circuits. Sales fell off sharply, and CEC eventually can-celed production of the YT-1200 and retrofitted the remaining stock with better systems, releasing those refit ships as the YT-1210 and the YT-1250.

Similar in size and appearance to the T-65, the E-wing has a long, narrow fuselage with a steeply sloped nose. Two fixed position s-foils slant down from ventral port and starboard wing roots aft of the centrally mounted cockpit. Mounted beneath each s-foil is a FreiTek J8LF fusial thrust engine, a copy of Incom's famous 4L4 FTE which powers the X-wing, and a Taim & Bak IX9 medium laser cannon. A third IX9 is mounted dorsally above the cockpit and just forward of a sealed astromech droid compartment, an awkward placement that requires the cannon's barrel be unshipped every time the cockpit canopy is opened. The E-wing also mounts two proton torpedo launchers in a tandem modular weapons bay located amidships on the fighter's ventral surface. The avionics and fire control systems are modern or upgraded versions of the systems found in current X-wing models. \n\n[P]As it was to be a multi-role fighter like the X-wing, the E-wing was designed with a good balance of strike and space superiority capabilities. The lightens armor and shields were equal to or better than anything in its class, and the mix of energy weapons and ordnance gave it a nearly unparalleled tactical versatility. Unfortunately, supply problems and a short-sighted rush to production led to some teething issues among the first group of E-wings. Within the first few months of service, the new fighters gained a reputation as finicky, unreliable maintenance hogs and hangar queens that spent as much or more time standing still as they did flying.

Based on SFS's popular Skipray-class hull, the [I]Legate[i]-Class is a medium courier ship designed to carry passengers and medium-sized parcels over long distances. Thanks to their combat ship lineage, [I]Legates[i] are fast, well-built, sturdy vessels that can take a surprising amount of abuse. They have a small crew—only a pilot and co-pilot—and a modular hold that can be configured to carry a small amount of cargo and two human-sized passengers in a solid degree of comfort.\n[P]Like the [I]Skipray[i]-class, from which it is descended, the [I]Legat[i]-class features a sleek forward hull section with stubby, sponson-like wings port and starboard. The ship's aft section is dominated by a small SFS Mk. IX Bantam lightweight ship reactor powering two X.a-14 fusial thrust engines mounted in port and starboard nacelles. Long, thin vertical stabilizers extend from the ventral and dorsal surfaces of the reactor housing reminiscent of the [I]Skipray's[i] cruciform aft S-foil configuration. For self-defense, each mounts a pair of light laser cannons in a fixed mount under the nose and a pair of light ion cannons in a dorsal turret, giving the ship a respectable punch and allowing it to fight off all but the most dedicated attackers.\n[P]Although it has only been on the market for a few years, the [I]Legate[i]-class courier has already proven itself a rugged and reliable ship. Crews report that it is a dream to fly and is easy to maintain, with good support from SFS. Some have also stated that fitting systems from the [I]Skipray[i]-class, such as engines, weapons systems, and shield generators, is surprisingly easy. Indeed of the wiring and many fittings for the military systems are still intact behind the courier's deck, walls, and bulkheads.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 62 - Endless Vigil[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":18,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":13,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":65000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Legate-Class Courier","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Live-Haul manufactured by Rothara Heavy Engineering was the default choice for the transport of massive live cargo by the Republic's Department of Agriculture and Nonsentient Creatures at the time the Clone Wars began. At the start of the war, many non-military vessels were pressed into service in support of the newly formed Grand Army of the Republic, the LH75 among them. Kuat Drive Yards was contracted to complete this task for many vessels, including the LH75. The LH75 Live Haul was able to carry and haul the spatial and weight equivalent of three fully grown bull rancors with relative ease, even into low orbit. With minimal modification by KDY and the original manufacturer (a subsidiary), the LH75 was soon fit to transport up to three squads and their support vehicles. Unsurprisingly, the LH75 was uniquely suitable among the GAR's landing craft for the transport of riding beasts. As the war progressed, Clone Troopers operating on a number of worlds made use of local life for transportation and even combat, such as the Blurrg of Ryloth. Some of these ad-hoc cavalry units found the mounts so useful, that officers arranged for permanent acquisition of the creatures. The LH75 was a natural choice for deployment of these mounted units.\n[P]Having never been intended to operate near the front lines, the L.O.S. Live-Haul was lightly armed and often traveled with a protective escort near active combat zones. Still, clone troopers found ways to improvise combat readiness out of this lightweight yet massive ship. With the massive cargo doors open during flight. troopers were able lay down small-arms fire by securing themselves to the many freight webbing hook points throughout the cargo bay floor originally intended as tie points for live cargo.\n[P]Due to the limited production run of these ships and sometimes-reckless usage by clone troopers, the L.O.S. Live-Haul is a rare find today. Owing to its mammoth power intake, the occasional intact ship is more commonly used as a storage facility on Outer Rim planets. Fewer still have found their way into the hands of smugglers wishing to transport massive live game for wealthy customers.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 60 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":32,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Medium","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":90,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":1000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":126000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"LH75 Specialty Live-Haul Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Skipray Blastboat is a heavily armed and armored patrol craft and gunboat descended from the ancient Turbostorm-class gunships used by the Old Republic. Officially listed as a patrol boat in SFS advertising, the Skipray seems to defy classification. Slightly larger than a typical heavy starfighter, these ships consist of a narrow, heavily reinforced and armored forward hull section and an aft rotating wing and pylon section. The forward section houses the four crew in a reinforced command cabin. Two short canards angle down from the sides of the cockpit, each equipped with a Siep-Irol Omni-Vu sensor array that gives the Skipray exceptional battlespace awareness. The forward hull section also houses the majority of the ship's weapons systems, with an ion cannon, proton torpedo launcher, and concussion missile launcher clustered in the nose and a turret-mounted twin laser cannon aft of the cockpit on the ship's dorsal ridge. The rotating wing assembly that makes up the aft third of the ship consists of two swept-forward wings connected to an armored collar rotating around the ship's powerful single ion engine. The wings are deployed in a vertical configuration for flight and rotate horizontally for landing, and each is tipped with an ion cannon. \n\n[P]Although it was initially designed for use by the Imperial Navy as a heavy, hyperspace-capable starfighter, it was largely rejected by the Admiralty as it didn't fit into the Navy's rigid order of battle, which at the time eschewed heavy, multi-crewed fighters. In response, SFS began selling the Skipray on the open market. There it garnered a loyal following among both planetary defense forces and the various corporate, mercenary, and pirate fleets that operate in the Outer Rim. Skiprays make a deadly and competent patrol and anti-shipping vessels, and can easily threaten ships many times their size.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":150000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"GAT-12H Skipray Blastboat","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Ion Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Ion Cannon[h3]\n\nIon weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets.

{"name":"G-1A Heavy Starfighter","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]G-1A Heavy Starfighter[h3]\nThe G-1A Heavy Starfighter is a large, sturdily built craft with a flexible battlefield role that endears it to some Outer Rim freelancers. Originally designed as an all-purpose system patrol craft by Byblos Drive Yards, the G-1A is a handsome, well-designed ship constructed for speed rather than agility. It has a tall, narrow, single-decked hull with bluff bows and a long, fixed position, transparisteel canopy that stretches nearly the entire length of the ship's dorsal side. Two powerful Byblos BPS-980 ion drives are mounted in tandem high on the ship's stern, and a massive articulated wing assembly mounted abaft the canopy provides lift and maneuverability. The ship's cramped interior holds five crewmembers and is accessed through an armored midships hatch on the starboard side.\n[P]Designed originally as a system patrol and interdiction craft, the G-1A shares a number of features in common with other popular ships of its size. It is moderately armored, but has a sturdy hull with reinforced keel and one of the highest-performance shield generators of any ship in its class. From the factory, it carries a respectable weapons loadout consisting of energy weapons and heavy ordnance launchers. Its sensors and comms package is respectable, if not particularly outstanding, and its targeting and flight control systems are intuitive and well designed.\n[P]Overall, the G-!A is a well-liked, well-designed vessel, if perhaps a bit unexciting. While it doesn't stand out in any one particular way performance-wise, where it does shine is in its modification potential.\n[P]Byblos envisioned the G-1A as a basic ship that could be outfitted with aftermarket weapons and sensor packages—designed and sold by BDY, of course—to tailor the ship to a particular user's needs. Unfortunately, due to a number of market factors, the G-1A never gained the popularity or sales numbers that BDY expected, and plans for th product line were drastically scaled back. Few of the aftermarket packages were ever built, and those that remain are vanishingly rare. Due to their modular nature, however, these ships are eminently modifiable, and can withstand an enormous amount of tinkering and jury rigging without suffering in their performance.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 59 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":25,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":130000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"G-1A Heavy Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Initially, only six prototypes were built and delivered to a Republic prison on Oovo IV shortly before the Battle of Naboo. Of those six ships, one was stolen by a bounty hunter named Jango Fett, and the other five destroyed to deter pursuit. The loss of such expensive prototypes came as a heavy blow to KSE, and they mothballed the Firespray program. \n\n[P]Envisioned primarily as a pursuit and system patrol craft, the original six Firesprays were powered by a quartet of KuatX-F-1 6 high-output power generators powering a pair of KDY F-31 ion engines that took up much of the ship's internal space. The combination of generators and drives gave the ships more than enough speed to deal with errant freighters, transports, and shuttles. Designed for utility rather than comfort, the ships' interior spaces were incredibly cramped. A small cargo hold is located in the lower aft section of the ship, equipped with a guard station and six small holding cells. Wedged in between the generators, ion drives, and other ship's systems is the unique rotating cockpit that moves the pilot and his controls through 180 degrees during take off and landing. \n\n[P]Recently, KSE re-introduced the Firespray to market in response to increased demand for law enforcement and patrol vessels from Imperial controlled worlds. The new ships are built from the plans for the original six prototypes, albeit with the benefit of three decades of advancement in shipbuilding technology. Thanks to growing demand and an aggressive advertising campaign, the new ships are a hot commodity among law enforcement agencies, bounty hunters, and even some smugglers and pirates.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":40,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":80000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":4,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Firespray Patrol Craft","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Auto-Blaster","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Auto-Blaster[h3]\n\nAuto blasters are rapid-fire variants of common blaster cannons.

{"name":"C-ROC Gozanti-Class Light Cruiser","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]C-ROC [I]Gozanti[i]-Class Light Cruiser[h3]\nThe C-ROC is a shipyard custom configuration for Corellian Engineering's [I]Gozanti[i]-class cruiser, Bulkier than the original [I]Gozanti[i]-class ships, the C-ROC was designed more for transport and cargo duties than for combat. Offered initially to the Imperial Navy—and rejected as inappropriate in the Imperial Navy's order of battle—as an armed, long-range transport, the C-ROC has become popular among both legitimate cargo operations and criminal organizations. These ships are especially popular in the Outer Rim, where the combination of hauling capacity, rugged construction, and respectable fighting capabilities have gained the class many admirers.\n[P]There are many modifications, both cosmetic and mechanical, that separate the C-ROC from its predecessor. Unlike the bold, square-shouldered lines of the original [I]Gozanti[i]-class ships, the C-ROC has a softer, more rounded hull design. The forward two-thirds of the ship has a sloping, bell-shaped cross-section that is narrow at the dorsal side and flaring out below the midships line. This new hull shape gives the ship a bit of extra protection as the slop of the hull deflects incoming blasts and ordnance more efficiently than its slab-sided predecessor. The cranked delta wings of the old ship are gone, replaced by outrigger cargo trays designed to carry modular shipping containers similar to those used by the venerable GR-75 medium transport. The outriggers, and a complete redesign of the ship's interior, give the C-ROC an impressive hauling capability at the expense of the ship's noted combat and fleet support utility.\n[P]The two original Girodyne Ter58 ion engines were  replaced by five newer, more efficient JV-80 ion drives by Novaldex—two each mounted port and starboard and one mounted on a dorsal spar. While the ship's armor and shielding remain largely unchanged from the original design, the weapons loadout has been drastically reduced. Two quad laser turrets—one ventral and one dorsal—provide good defense against small ships, such as starfighters and patrol boats. Each of the ship's broad flanks mounts a pair of heavy laser cannons, just enough to keep determined pirates and other undesirables at bay. While it carries nowhere near the firepower of the original design, the C-ROC is quite capable of handling most foreseeable threats without trouble.\n[P]While it hasn't been a wildly successful product, sales of the C-ROC are steady and CEC continues to produce updates and replacements for the ship's various systems. With the rise of the Empire and the increasing lawlessness in the Outer Rim, many of these ships have been pressed into duty by various rebel cells as ersatz capital ships. While unsuited to serving as front line warships, C-ROCs are capable enough—especially when manned by a cunning and motivated crew—to deal with most of the old vessels the Imperial Navy uses to maintain law and order out on society's fringes.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 62 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":55,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":40,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":3,"port":2,"starboard":2,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Medium","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":20,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":1800,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":190000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"C-ROC Gozanti-Class Light Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Quad Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Quad Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nQuad lasers are dedicated anti-starfighter-weapons consisting of four small-caliber laser cannons linked to a single firing mechanism and slaved to a sophisticated fire-control system.

A lovely ship by any standard, this small, nimble freighter shows all the hallmarks of the smooth-edged, quasi-organic styling for which the Mon Calamari shipwrights are so famous. A Simiyiar-class vessel is flat, low-slung, and single-decked, with a bulbous forward section, a narrow midships section. and a flaring, wing-like aft section. The entire forward third of the ship is given over to its cargo hold, a capacious modular space accessed by port and starboard cargo lifts and a ventral loading ramp. The midships section contains crew and passenger berthing and common areas, as well as a ladderway to the small, two-person command deck. In addition to its drive, most of the ship's power, weapons, and hyperspace systems are housed in the outboard wing sections or the flaring forward section, and a pair of escape pods are mounted directly aft, over the primary thrusters. \n\n[P]Relatively heavily armed for a vessel of its class, the Simiyiar is armed with a turret-mounted twin light laser cannon on the dorsal surface and a single light ion cannon in a fixed forward position. Speed and handling are a little above average, and the stout, ablative armor and well-tuned shields provide more than adequate protection. Although popular, Simiyiar-class light freighters suffer many of the downsides common to Mon Calamari ships. Each ship is unique, essentially hand-made, and there is little-to-no parts commonality from one to another. As such, they are among the most expensive light freighters on the market. They are very reliable, however, and achingly beautiful. These two traits alone are enough to explain the popularity of these fine little ships.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":16,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":90,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":165000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Simiyiar Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

The sole product of Kazellis Corporation, a small, ambitious, tragically short lived shipyard in the Kathol sector, the [I]Kazellis[i]-class is a wonderful example of the shipwright's craft. Kazellis Corp set out to provide small cargo firms with a \"pre-customized\" vessel that was versatile and useful right off the slips, without need for lengthy and expensive aftermarket modifications. Using  top-of-the-line parts from providers such as Fabritech, Isa Sim, Girodyne, and Phoah Kinsmeyer, the shipwrights at Kazellis produced a multipurpose vessel that could often outfly, outcarry, and outrun anything in its class. [I]Kazellis[i]-class freighters entered the market just months before the outbreak of the Clone Wars to great, fanfare, but political upheaval in the Kathol system combined with some unfortunate business decisions by corporate leadership, ended their production run after only a few short years.\n[P]Today, the [I]Kazellis[i]-class light freighter is a vanishingly rare sight. Many starship enthusiasts lament its limited production, because it is perhaps, on of the loveliest ship classes ever constructed. The ship has a broad hill shaped like a half moon, with its convex edge defining the aft, like the venerable YT-series freighters. The forward light deck emerges gracefully from the main hull, and from above or below, the vessel resembles a large bird in mid-flight. The interiors are well appointed, and the ship's systems are laid out in an intelligent, easy to access manner. The hold is modular, with sliding bulkheads and decks that allow it to be configured to carry nearly any cargo. The downsides, aside from the scarcity of parts and technical information, are its sub-par weapon systems and light shields.

{"name":"Vigil-Class Corvette","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]Vigil-Class Corvette[h3]\n\nProduced by Kuat Drive Yards for the Imperial Navy, the Vigil-class corvette is the smallest vessel in the iconic Star Destroyer class of ships. Lightly armed and armored, it shares the dagger-shaped hull and large crew of its larger siblings, and operates as both a picket and reconnaissance vessel as well as an escort ship for larger, cruiser-sized ships. Their command decks sit flush with the hull, all the way aft over the main drive thrusters. This gives the Vigil-class a smaller silhouette and protects the crew better than the tall, exposed control towers found on larger KDY vessels. For its primary armament, the Vigil-class carries a trio of turret-mounted heavy turbolasers on the dorsal hull, giving it quite a heavy punch for so small a vessel.

Created by Rendilli Stardrives almost five hundred years ago to capitalize on one of the many Outer Rim expansion and colonization drives, the Xanter trades the weaponry of other, similar-sized vessels for unparalleled endurance. \n\n[P]The ship can last for years without resupply, and every aspect of living space is designed with long-term habitation in mind. The Xanter's crew quarters are spacious and well appointed, each crew member has his own berth to provide guaranteed privacy and personal space. The galley can create a wide variety of passable and varied food, and the recreational facilities provide a number of enjoyable amusements. There is even a hydroponic garden that doubles as an observation dome, providing fresh food and oxygen while also giving the crew a place to relax amongst vegetation and the vastness of space. \n\n[P]However, the Xanter is still a warship and exploration vessel. Emergency bulkheads can seal off most parts of the ship, and even the observation dome has a retractable cover of hardened durasteel. The YDFed ion drives and hyperdrive systems have triple redundancies built in, almost guaranteeing that the ship cannot be stranded in wild space. Finally, the Xanter mounts turbolasers, ion cannons, and heavy laser cannons for starfighter and capital-ship defense. \n\n[P]Although the Xanter is no longer produced, it is still possible to find these ships amongst some corporations and expeditions in the Outer Rim. Tough, durable, and reliable ships such as these will always have a place in exploration.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":1,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":80,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":32,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":2,"starboard":2,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":50,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":3750000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Xanter-class Deep-Space Exploration Frigate","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Descended from earlier KSE designs and the Delta-X technology testbed, the Delta-6 was envisioned initially as a short-range point defense interceptor. An incredibly simple starfighter. the Delta-6 is a lightweight, single-seat interceptor with a narrow, arrowhead-shaped hull. Mounted all the way aft over the engines is a tiny, cramped cockpit with a bubble canopy, which gives the pilot a nearly 360-degree view of the surroundings. Standard armament consists of a pair of high-output Taim & Bak light laser cannons, with light armor and shields. As they are short-range fighters, these fighters have no hyperdrives, astromech ports, or navicomputers, and carry only minimal stores. \n\n[P]After its initial release and the first glowing reviews of its performance and efficiency, the Delta-6 caught the eye of the Jedi Order. The Order took delivery of several squadrons of Sprites, which quickly became the Jedi's go-to fightercraft. After decades of faithful service, the Sprite's short range and light armament were seen as outdated, and they were phased out in favor of the Delta-7 and Delta-7B.

Known primarily for their mining interests, they are relative newcomers to the shipbuilding industry. One of their first forays into shipbuilding came at the end of the Clone Wars with the introduction of the E-9 unarmed light freighter. \n\n[P]It was, to put it mildly, a colossal failure upon delivery. The ship suffered not from production or quality failures (in fact it was an excellent small freighter) but from political turmoil and intense competition from Corellian Engineering's already entrenched and wildly popular YT series of light freighters. \n\n[P]After a few years of dismal sales, the E-9 was discontinued as a light freighter, redesigned, and rereleased as a long-range armed scouting vessel. Most of the ship's systems remained the same, as did its swooping, organic-looking hull, but the sensors, flight control, and computer systems were all upgraded and optimized for reconnaissance and scouting. Cargo capacity was reduced significantly to make way for larger engines and a more powerful power generator, and a pair of turret-mounted laser cannons were added for defense. After a fair amount of legal wrangling with the newly ascendant Empire, which looked askance at civilian shipbuilders mounting weapons to their products, the rebadged E-9 Explorer-class ships were introduced just as the Empire solidified its control over the galaxy. \n\n[P]Some of the larger ships in their class, the Explorer-class ships are built for endurance and reliability. The hull is low and long, with soft, curved lines and a silhouette reminiscent of a sea creature. It has a medium-sized cargo hold equipped with a convenient load-management and inventory computer that assists in loading, unloading, and tracking cargo. It also boasts a quartet of small but comfortable passenger berths, a common-crew berthing area, and a common galley/head. The command deck is directly forward and seats three of the four-man crew: the pilot, copilot, and engineer. The loadmaster's station is in the cargo hold. \n\n[P]Despite their age, Explorer-class ships have a considerably modern layout, making accessing the various compartments and holds easy and intuitive. With their powerful scouting sensor arrays, reliable engines and flight-control computers, and onboard weapon systems, the Explorer-class ships are perfectly suited for long-range scouting, exploration, and even light trade.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":25,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":60,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":120000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Loronar E-9 Explorer-class Long Range Scout","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Lightly armed\nand armored, they have a thin, dagger-shaped hull\nsimilar to that of the larger Vindicator-class cruisers.\nUnlike those ships, however, the Surveyor class has\nno command tower. Instead, a broad, heavily shielded\nstructure like a bunker rises at the aft of the ship and\nextends over the main drives; a similar structure can be seen on Bellator-class dreadnoughts. This structure\nhouses not only the command deck, but also the powerful\nsensor suites with which the ship is equipped.\n[P]While the Surveyor class can fight — it possesses a\nrespectable collection of turbolasers and ion cannons,\nalong with one squadron of fightercraft — its primary\npurpose is reconnaissance and exploration.

Related to Corellian Engineering's CR70 and CR90 corvettes, the Consular-class served the Old Republic as an unarmed VIP transport, carrying diplomats and other government officials throughout the galaxy on official business. In the deep crimson livery of the Republic Diplomatic Corps, these ships cut a dashing figure with their bluff-bowed, wasp-waisted profile. Lightly crewed, they carried their VIPs in style in a detachable, modular \"salon pod\" slung beneath the ship's command deck. Large enough for a handful of people, and extremely well-appointed with all of the privacy and communications technology required by a diplomatic mission, the Consulars were among the most recognizable vessels in space before the fall of the Old Republic. \n\n[P]Few of these once proud ships survived the rise of the Empire. Many were destroyed, and those that weren't were mothballed or broken apart and recycled. However, a few have been brought back into service by the Alliance, armed with a motley array of laser cannons and turbolasers and used as light assault carriers and command ships. While they are often outclassed by Imperial ships, Consular-class cruisers still perform well, and they are well liked by their Rebel crews and those who must travel in them.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":46,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":24,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":16,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":3200,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":3400000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Consular-Class Light Assault Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Ion Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Ion Cannon[h3]\n\nIon weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets.

Despite its speed and firepower, however, the MC30c possesses very light armor. For this reason, MC30c frigates rarely operate away from the main fleet.\n[P]One unique feature of the MC30c is its use of cluster bombs, which are dispersed by launchers in order\nto destroy and deter enemy fighters. Whenever a ship enters closer range with an MC30c frigate that has dispersed its cluster bombs, it is exposed to the devices. The pilot of such a ship must succeed on a Hard [DI][DI]) Piloting check or suffer a hit for 6 damage.

The latest release from MandalMotors, created on special commission for the Black Sun, the [I]Lancer[i] is more an interdiction and patrol vessel than it is a workaday cargo hauler. Designed to chase down fleeing  cargo vessels or outrun other patrol ships, these vessels are fast, tough, and able to withstand hard use with irregular maintenance. They were designed to fly, fight, and survive in the most dangerous and remote parts of the galaxy from understocked, often improvised facilities. To that end, they have numerous redundant systems and are quite easy to maintain. In addition, they are highly modular, allowing for a broad array of modifications to fit the needs of nearly any user. This makes them extremely attractive to smugglers, bounty hunters, and many backwater planetary governments looking for a fast, cheap, and well-armed patrol ship.\n[P]Roughly the size of a YT-1200, the [I]Lancer[i]-class has a thin, suacer-like main hull reminiscent of many of CEC's more popular ships. A narrow, two-position tandem cockpit protrudes from the sucer's forward leading edge, and seats a pilot and co-pilot in cramped but well laid-out surroundings. A bank of powerful sublight engines mounted aft proves the primary thrust, and a pair of high performance ion engines are mounted on two short, squat, midships-mounted sponsons, providing a powerful boost when needed. While not as agile as a starfighter, the [I]Lancer[i]'s drives five it exceptional straight-line speed, enough to run down nearly anything in its class. While its shields are minimal and its armor is light, the [I]Lancer[i]'s speed and narrow silhouette make it a difficult target to track and hit in the heat of a battle. The ship's primary armament is relatively light—a pair of fire-linked light blaster cannons, a triple light laser turret, and a tractor beam emitter—but a state of the art fire control system makes them incredibly potent.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 61 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":5,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":60,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":120000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Lancer-Class Pursuit Craft","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

{"name":"Prototype-B6","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]Prototype-B6[h3]\nPrototype-B6, also known as the Blade Wing, is a one-off starfighter that served as the prototype for the Rebellion’s powerful B-wing heavy attack starfighter. Hand-built in a floating junkyard by an elderly and cantankerous Mon Calamari naval engineer named Quarrie, the B6 was as much a design exercise as his attempt to build a functioning starfighter. Long and thin, this proto-B-wing is a rough-hewn machine clearly assembled from secondhand, reclaimed, and recycled parts. Despite its unpromising looks, after a stunning maiden flight in which it destroyed an Imperial Navy [I]Arquitens[i]-class light cruiser and broke a blockade, the fighter and its creator were brought into the resistance’s early research divisions for further research and development.\n[P]When first discovered by resistance operatives, the Blade Wing already exhibited most the features that would eventually be built into the B-wing: a long, narrow, dagger-shaped fuselage with two short, variable-geometry S-foils tipped with weapon clusters. One end of the fuselage holds the one-position cockpit in a gyroscopically stabilized ring that allows the entire fuselage to rotate around it. A second, smaller pod mounted opposite the cockpit houses a gunner, who operates many of the ship’s weapon systems. Four massive ion engines provide copious amounts of thrust and give the prototype incredible straight-line speed, while a finely tuned repulsorlift generator and a handful of maneuvering thrusters give the big fighter a surprising amount of agility.\n[P]In an attempt to see just how much firepower he could fit in his revolutionary new fighter, Quarrie jammed as many weapon systems into the Blade Wing as he could find. Auto-blasters, ion cannons, various calibers of laser cannons, and a pair of ordnance launchers salvaged from a Skipray patrol craft make up the ship’s primary weapons loadout. Not content with this, Quarrie has designed a unique fire-linking system that draws power from all weapon systems-along with the shields, engines, and numerous other systems by accident-to create an ersatz energy weapon he calls the composite laser weapon, or CLW. Although wildly unstable and prone to knocking half the ship’s systems offline when used, the CLW provides the Blade Wing with a weapon equal to light turbolaser in power and armor-piercing capabilities. Using the CLW is always a risk, and it was deleted from the B-wing before that ship went into production.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 125 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":18,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":4,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":2147483647,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":10,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Prototype-B6","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Auto-Blaster","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Auto-Blaster[h3]\n\nAuto blasters are rapid-fire variants of common blaster cannons.

Designed by Sienar Ships, a long-defunct civilian subsidiary of Sienar Fleet Systems, they were first produced centuries before the Clone Wars. Initially designed as long-range survey vessels, they would fly to the very edges of the known galaxy to chart distant, unknown stars and plot new hyperspace lanes. To that end, they were outfitted with robust life-support systems to keep the crew and any passengers healthy, happy, and mentally stimulated for months or even years at space. While these ships were never considered fast, they were comfortable, tough, well-equipped vessels that could take a small crew of pilots and surveyors into the unknown in relative safety and comfort.\n[P]As is the case with most vessels of their age and type precious few [I]Alidade[i]-class vessels remain in space. Time has been their most dangerous enemy. Many succumbed to fatigue or critical malfunction in far-off systems and were then simply abandoned by their crew, too old and expensive to fix. Others fell prey to pirates, stellar phenomena, or one of the countless other threats inherent in exploring the galaxy's wild spaces. Those that remain in use are lovingly tended to by their crews, and a thriving ownership culture has sprung up around them. An [I]Alidade[i] in port always attracts former owners, pilots, crew, or even passengers with fond memories of their time spent aboard one.

Developed in response to a sharp increase in both smuggling and legal shipping carried out on behalf of the Alliance to Restore the Republic, the Aggressor is a heavily armed fast-attack fighter designed for commerce raiding and interdiction. Longer than a common TIE/In, the TIE/ag is a two-position fighter featuring a number of design features common to all TIE-series ships such as the lack of shields or native hyperdrive capabilities, the signature twin ion engines, the spherical command pod, and the broad solar collector wings. Unlike the TIE/In, the Aggressor features an extended hull that provides room for a dedicated gunner to operate the dorsal turret-mounted light laser cannons which are the fighter's primary weapons. Rounding out the Aggressor's impressive loadout are a pair of medium laser cannons mounted on external hardpoints beneath the solar collector spars. \n[P]Although the Aggressor has only been in Imperial service for a short time, the new fighter has already garnered a reputation as a reliable, easy to fly, and deadly combatant. Flown only by experienced TIE pilots of at least the rank of lieutenant, the combination of TIE-series speed and maneuverability and the heavy punch of the weapons systems makes the Aggressor well-suited for its role. This is, of course, very much to the chagrin of Rebel starfighter pilots and freighter captains who have had the dubious pleasure of tangling with an Aggressor squadron.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":7,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":75000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":9,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"TIE/AG \"Aggressor\" Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Its power and versatility are unlike anything seen before, and it promises to change the face of warfare. The battle station's self-sufficiency, hyperspace capability, and ability to operate without escort or support vessels allow it to bring its terrifying superlaser to bear anywhere in the galaxy. Grand Moff Tarkin believes that the constant fear of it appearing in orbit over their planet will keep rebellion-minded citizens in line. He himself fears nothing and no one in the galaxy could possibly harm the Death Star.\n[H4]Death Star Fire Arcs[h4]\nThe shape and sheer size of the Death Star makes determining fire arcs for its weapons a tricky proposition. At any angle of attack, an incoming ship has hundred-perhaps thousands- of turbolasers, ordnance launchers, point defense weapons, and tractor beam emitters pointed at it, following its every move. Weapons in the Death Star's profile, save for the unique superlaser, thus do not have fire arcs as part of their description. If Game Masters choose to have their players tangle with the Death Star, taking fire from the massive battle station should be even more narrative than usual.\n[P]One way to handle such an encounter is for the Game Master to describe the scene-space around the players' ship filled with turbolaser bolts, crackling ion blasts, the glowing warheads of concussion missiles, etc.-and then pick out one or two of the Death Star's weapon systems to target the players' ship specifically. This gives the players an idea of the strength of the battle station as a general threat as well as presenting a concrete threat from weapons that are actually targeting them.

The AO-2 serves a single purpose-to deliver combatants to a planet's surface as rapidly as possible. To this end, its design eschews nearly all other considerations to arrive at what amounts to little more than a heavily armored passenger compartment capable of achieving impressive velocity along a straight course.\n[P]The [I]Cometstrike[i] is intended to launch from high orbit-often directly from a ship's hangar bay-hurtling directly toward a planet's surface at high speed. Once a course is set and landing coordinates programmed, an on-board computer handles any necessary course corrections. The speed of the descent prevents enemy fighters from engaging the assault pod, and even the most sophisticated ground-defense weapons have great difficulty zeroing in on such a small, rapidly moving target. Proximity sensors activate powerful repulsor engines to slow the pod's descent for a safe, if impactful, landing. Upon arrival, a single pull of a switch by any occupant drops twin boarding ramps on opposite sides of the hull, allowing passengers to swiftly engage the enemy.\n[P]The AO-2 receives its primary propulsion from powerful trifold ion turbines protruding from its dorsal hull. Once a [I]Cometstrike[i]'s trajectory is set, no pilot is necessary for the initial descent, and in fact, a pilot can make only minor course adjustments with the ventral attitude thrusters. In addition, the AO-2 is equipped with a repulsorlift engine for purposes of retrieval, allowing a pilot to move the pod slowly and ponderously to rendezvous with a landing craft or even a ship in low orbit. Retractable pintle-mounted heavy repeating blasters located above each hatch allow passengers to lay down covering fire while their teammates debark.\n[P]Cygnus Spaceworks designed the original AO-1 orbital assault pod for use by the Grand Army of the Republic. After Republic Command deemed the vehicle too dangerous for use by clone troopers and Cygnus lost its contract, the company was able to salvage the program with a handful of improved safety features, marketing the resulting AO-2 to mercenary companies and several minor warlords on the periphery of the Unknown Regions.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 56 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-5,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":14,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":30000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"AO-2 Cometstrike-class Orbital Assault Pod","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"AO2ORBASPOD"}},"_id":"WqHHE9d9gog0oyb8"}

Like all Star Destroyer-type warships, the Praetor II has a long, thin, arrowhead-shaped hull covered in bone-colored armor plating and bristling with all manner of turbolaser turrets, laser cannons, ion cannons, and anti-fighter weapon systems. Nearly five times as long as an Imperial II-class vessel, these massive ships are typically assigned as command vessels for sector fleets, rarely leaving their berths except in times of dire need or in the case of a full-fleet engagement somewhere within their sphere of influence. While they share many design queues with the other ships in the Star Destroyer line, Praetors lack the towering bridge and sensor superstructure found on the lighter Imperial and Victory-class ships. Instead, they have a broad, heavily armored bunker-like ridge that runs along the dorsal surface from amidships aft and extends over the stern. Most of the crew live and work in this area, as the rest of the ship is given over to machine spaces, control systems, and the other necessary engineering areas. \n\n[P]While the Praetor ll battlecruisers have their weaknesses, it's incredibly difficult to leverage knowledge of them into any kind of victory. These vessels never travel alone; they are constantly tended to by battlegroups composed of a number of different vessel classes and surrounded by a thick cloud of vigilant TIE fighters. Their long range armament makes them difficult to reach, as they can hull an enemy heavy cruiser or battle ship well before the enemy can reach the Imperial forces. Those few Rebel fleets that have tangled with a Praetor have discovered that destroying one of these vessels is easier done through boarding or sabotage while it's docked as opposed to facing its planet-crushing firepower head-to-head.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":9,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":185,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":95,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":3,"port":3,"starboard":3,"aft":3,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":11,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":14000,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":700000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":9,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Praetor II-Class Star Battlecruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Massive, imposing ships with a long arrowhead-shaped hull and a towering, heavily armored superstructure, these vessels were designed as much to intimidate and sow fear as they were to fight other battleship-type vessels. Probably the most common vessel in the Imperial fleet, they are over a kilometer long, heavily shielded, bristling with weapons, and manned by the best and brightest officers and crew the Navy has to offer. Along with their offensive weaponry. they carry six squadrons of TIE fighters, typically a mix of standard /In fighters, interceptors, and bombers, along with a variety of shuttlecraft, landing craft, and numerous ground vehicles. A single Imperial I can take control of an entire planet, or simply lay it to waste with a powerful orbital bombardment, and a battlegroup led by such a vessel can lock an entire sector down with ease. \n\n[P]Despite their well-deserved reputation for power and resilience, and despite what the Imperial admiralty would have the galaxy believe, Imperial-class ships are far from indestructible. Even though their hulls are littered with various sizes of turbolaser turrets, ion cannons, tractor beam projectors, and anti-fighter weapons batteries, there are still blind spots where weapons can't reach. A well-flown fighter or small gunboat can squeeze through and deliver deadly blows with bombs and torpedoes. In addition, thanks to cost-saving measures and quirks of design, a few important parts of the hull are surprisingly lightly armored; a battlegroup commander with a brave squadron and a working knowledge of Imperial tactics can neutralize one of these massive vessels with surprising ease. However, they are not to be underestimated, and their fighter squadrons, the battlegroups with which they invariably travel, and the tactical know-how of their commanders make them incredibly tough nuts to crack.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":145,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":60,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":3,"port":3,"starboard":3,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":9700,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":150000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Imperial I-Class Star Destroyer","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Designed as a traveling dry dock and starship maintenance facility, each is a thin vessel of impressive size, appearing more like an elegant building than a starship. Long docking arms with many ports project from the vertical main hull, along with huge horizontal support frames to aid in drydock repairs. A huge superstructure like a small city rises above the docking facilities and houses the ship's crew, passengers, and support facilities. Each docking facility can handle a frigate- or cruiser-sized vessel of up to silhouette 6, and the ship houses enough technicians, workshops, fabrication facilities, laboratories, and other facilities to repair even seriously damaged ships or maintain a small fleet or battle group in space.\n[P]Neither fast nor agile, [I]Haven[i]-class ships are extremely vulnerable to attack. While they have thick armor and a respectable weapons load-out, their weapons are more anti-fighter and anti-boarding weapons than for assault. Due to their vulnerability, these ships are typically escorted by one or more frigates to provide combat support, or are part of a larger battle group and rely on the strength of the other ships to defend them. Although they often have starfighters aboard from visiting ships that can be scrambled in an emergency, [I]Haven[i]-class ships are not set up to launch and recover fighters; doing so can be a chaotic and dangerous affair. Few of these valuable vessels exist, and almost all of them are in the Imperial Navy. The Alliance Navy currently owns two: a fully operational ship called [I]Sanctum[i], and a heavily damaged recent capture that was known in the Imperial Navy called [I]Reserve[i], currently undergoing repair and refit at an Alliance-controlled shipyard.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 59 - Fully Operational[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":100,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":75,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":2,"starboard":2,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Long","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":8000,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":30000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":38000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":9,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Haven-Class Mobile Space Dock","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

A small, unremarkable craft, the G9 has a blocky, double-decked hull which resembles a speeder truck more than a starship. A single long, thin wing extends from the starboard side of the ship, and a short folding stabilizer is mounted to the vessel's ventral side. The forward third of the vessel contains the flight deck, engineering deck, and crew quarters on two spartan decks. The rest of the ship is given over to a single large cargo hold accessed by a large aft-loading ramp. \n\n[P]Designed as a utilitarian, short-to-medium-range hauler, the Rigger-class has little in the way of amenities and only the most basic of defensive systems. Armament consists of dorsal auto-blasters and two light blaster cannons. Shields are a simple low-output Novaldex system, and the ship's armor is basic carbon-durasteel. Little thought was given to speed or handling, and while these ships aren't dangerously slow or sluggish, they are not high-performance by any stretch of the imagination. What they lack in frills and comfort, however, these little ships more than make up for in reliability, sturdiness, and ease of repair. In fact, so well-built are these ancient freighters that many are still operating, and operating quite well, with much of their original equipement.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":22,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":80,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":55000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"G9 Rigger Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Auto-Blaster","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Auto-Blaster[h3]\n\nAuto blasters are rapid-fire variants of common blaster cannons.

The Striker fills a number of roles—dogfighter, interdiction, and ground attack—and does so extremely well. Striker squadrons are typically deployed to important Imperial planetary facilities and operate alongside other TIE squadrons.\n[P]The design of the TIE/sk is as much of a departure from the rest of the TIE series as its intended role. Instead of the usual spherical fuselage, the Striker features an elongated, lozenge-shaped fuselage equipped with advanced avionics, a life-support system, a low-yield shield generator, and a small space that can hold small cargoes or a single passenger. Two variable-geometry S-foils, similar in shape to those found on the TIE/ln, are mounted to the fighter and give it its distinctive silhouette. Depending on flight conditions and angle of attack, the S-foils automatically position themselves to maximize performance. Standard weapon loadout consists of linked heavy blaster cannons and a pair of medium laser cannons. These can be augmented with the addition of bombs or versatile flex-warhead launchers mounted on external hard points.

Essentially a Seeker writ large, the ZH-25 is a fast, reliable, easily modifiable freighter designed to compete against Corellian Engineering Corporation's YT- and YV-series freighters. With a hull that resembles a pair of magnoculars in planform, the ZH-25 consists of a central hull section of a vaguely hourglass shape with a CEC-style cockpit forward and a bank of powerful Novaldex JV-74 engines in the stern. The port and starboard hull sections contain crew quarters, common areas, and escape pods for crew and passengers. The aft two-thirds of the ship is given over to a massive open cargo hold equipped with all the usual modern cargo-handling systems. In addition, two external cargo pods are slung beneath the hull and serve to extend both the ship's carer) and storage capacity. \n\n[P]From the factory, Starfeld fits out the Questor with a single medium laser cannon in a ventral-mounted turret, good carbon-durasteel armor, and a reliable Sirplex shield generator, which together provide the vessel with respectable defensive capabilities. The crew and passenger areas, while utilitarian, are comfortable and designed to alleviate the stresses of long-distance travel in hyperspace. Like most light freighters from CEC, SoroSuub, and Ghtroc, the ZH-25 was built with an eye toward end-user modification and the use of aftermarket parts. To that end, these ships feature modular power fittings and numerous redundant systems that allow owners to easily customize their ships to their own tastes and needs. While still a relative newcomer to the freighter market, the ZH-25 is quick y gaining popularity among private shipping concerns, single owner-operators, and smugglers thanks to its reliability and smart design.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":30,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":100,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":115000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"ZH-25 Questor Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

After the battle, Mon Calamari Commander Ackbar was elevated to Alliance Fleet Admiral, and given Independence as his flagship.\n[P]The Independence led the Rebel Fleet through hyperspace, always a step ahead of the Empire, while countless guerrilla operations and fighter strikes launched from her hangars. The cruiser also serves as home to Alliance High Command, including Mon Mothma. As such, the Independence participates in a number of diplomatic summits and recruiting efforts.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Strongholds of Resistance[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":150,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":90,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":4,"port":4,"starboard":4,"aft":3,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Long","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1200,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":150000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Home One-Class Heavy Star Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

One result of this union of skills is the AD-1S Modular Multi-Role Starfighter. It was designed around a standard selection of modules users can employ to adapt the fighter as needed for different missions. Corporate designers believed that\ngovernments and militaries would like the economics of purchasing of one central chassis to build around, rather than paying for multiple classes of specialized ships for each task that might not always be needed. Thus, they developed the magnetic modular rail system that came to define the AD-1 S, which lets users rapidly equip new attachments.\n[P]Unfortunately, the cost to actually equip the fighter with components that meet military standards and Koensayr's noncompetitive lock on its proprietary parts and maintenance supplies diminished interest in the ship. However, the AD-1S found some success as a defender on board corporate and exploration\nstarships with limited hangar space, where its multimission capability became an asset. A starfighter of otherwise average capabilities, the AD-1S has always been more popular with Technicians than pilots. Its adaptable nature makes it very easy to swap in and out custom-made modules, many of which are\nscratch-built by enterprising owners. Despite Koensayr's attempted monopoly on the parts, many Technicians have found and modified similar products that work just as well with the ship’s magnetic modular rails, if not better.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 62 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":25000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"AD-1S Modular Multi-Role Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"AD1SMOD"}},"_id":"ZjAvizQHUpeQGHRy"}

Roughly the size of a small freighter or large shuttlecraft, the YQ-400 is a curious looking vessel whose design shares little in common with other Corellian Engineering Corporation products. The vessel's largest hull section consists of a single, high-performance ion turbine that looks as if it would be more at home on an Imperial cruiser. This is shrouded in three thin, angular hull plates, one mounted dorsally and two mounted low on the port and starboard sides, that protect the power generators and secondary thrusters. It has a blunt, rounded bow section dominated by a single, massive, deep blue photoreceptor four meters across. This section houses the droid brain that runs the ship, as well as all of its communications, avionics, and sensor systems. While they are well armed with laser cannons and ion weaponry, and are no slouch in a fight, Monitor-class droid ships are programmed to never fire on another vessel unprovoked. \n[P]The droids that control the YQ-400s have a suspicious, officious personality and are possessed of near endless amounts of low cunning. Those individuals who work with them state that the droids are obsessive, worry about inconsequential details while often missing a larger picture, and have a tendency to speak and act like a peevish middle manager rather than a vigilant watcher. When in service, these vessels typically patrol a pre-determined route using only passive sensors to monitor space traffic, and are under orders to follow any suspicious vessel and report its whereabouts to system traffic control officers immediately. \n\n[P]These unique ships were conceived and built by the Nerfworks, a semi-secret projects laboratory jointly funded by both Corellian Engineering Corporation and the Loronar Corporation. Located at CEC-L Shipyard Lab 6671-x42, Nerfworks combines the shipbuilding expertise of CEC with the talented programmers and neural engineers of the Loronar Corporation. Largely ignored by higher ups of both companies and given free rein with company expense accounts, Nerfworks is tasked with making breakthroughs in droid/starship interfaces.

A vast improvement over the awkward YT-450a and the undistinguished YT-700, the YT-1000 set the standard to which all subsequent YT-class ships would be held. The first of CEC's ships to be built around the now common Corellian saucer-shaped deck plan, the YT-1000 series possesses many of the features for which CEC is so famous and respected today. \n\n[P]Quicker in its stock configuration and smaller by a few meters than subsequent YT-series ships, these vessels were an instant sensation upon their release. First made available in the waning years of the Old Republic before the outbreak of the Clone Wars, YT-1000s offered a quick, efficient, versatile freighter with a large cargo capacity at a very respectable price. These ships were sold by the thousands, and they served as couriers, light freighters, VIP shuttles, and in countless other roles all across the galaxy. They remained popular even after the introduction of the improved YT-1100 and YT-1200 series and are still in demand today, especially among individuals in the Outer Rim who are just starting out life in the intergalactic trade industry. \n\n[P]YT-1000-series light freighters have the iconic saucer hull that has come to be a trademark of Corellian Engineering's ship-manufacturing arm. Its two-seat cockpit is located dorsally along the forward center line of the ship and is flanked by two cargo-loading mandibles. The main hull spars, corridors, and escape pods are located amidships, and two powerful ion engines dominate the aft section. They were equipped with turret-mounted laser cannons in the dorsal weapons mount from the factory, but as with all CEC ships, the weapons are easily upgraded for more powerful or accurate models. \n\n[P]The crew and passenger berths, while relatively spartan, are comfortable, and the ships are equipped with decent galley, refresher, and head facilities. As with subsequent YT-series ships, the cargo hold is large and modular and can be easily modified to carry any size or shape of cargo that will fit in the ship. Cargo and passengers are loaded from a ventral ramp, and a small hatch abaft the command deck gives access to the ship's dorsal surface.\n\n[P]While the YT-1000s have waned in popularity, especially after the introduction of the YT-1300-series freighters, they still remain in service throughout the Outer Rim and still fetch a respectable price when available for sale.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":150,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":75000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"YT-1000 Light Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Solidly built and packed with state of the art avionics and cargo handling systems, these massive vessels are shaped like a tuning fork with the crew, weapons, and engineering sections in the central hull and four airtight cargo holds in the port and starboard booms. The trademark CEC conical cockpit is located amidships between the booms, giving the pilot and co-pilot a nearly 180 degree view of their surroundings. The ship's primary selling point, aside from its vast cargo capacity for a ship of its size, is the design of its holds. Each of the four holds is shielded, reinforced, and contains a number of modular cargo systems that allow them to be configured for different types of cargo. In addition, each hold has its own environmental systems, allowing the crew to adjust the temperature, atmospheric makeup, and gravity of each hold separately. \n\n[P]Initial reviews were favorable, and orders steadily came in from large shipping concerns in the mid and Outer Rim territories. As pilots and crews became more familiar with them, however, they reported a number of serious shortcomings. While the hull and power distribution systems were designed to allow the types of modification and hot-rodding that CEC ships are famous for, the ships' primary power generator was woefully underpowered. In addition, thanks to these power shortcomings and the choice of Koensayr's single-tube ion drive as its primary drive, the HT-2200 proved slow and sluggish with poor acceleration and even poorer maneuverability. This, along with its surprisingly light weapons loadout, made the freighters easy pickings for pirates. Despite all of their inherent flaws, HT-2200s remain in limited production, thanks to their advanced cargo systems and sturdy hull.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Far Horizons[h4][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":35,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":14,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":800,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":140000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"HT-2200 Medium Freighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

{"name":"MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]MC80A [I]Home One[i] Type Heavy Star Cruiser[h3]\n\nA broadly defined class of large, purpose-built Mon\nCalamari battleships, the Home One type ships are\namong the Alliance Navy’s most powerful capital ships.\nNamed for Admiral Ackbar’s flagship, Home One, the\nvessels grouped into this class are larger and, overall,\nmore powerful than the Liberty type ships more commonly\nseen in Rebel battle groups. Like their smaller\ncousins, ships of the Home One type began operation\nas civilian craft, mostly passenger liners or deep-space\nexploration vessels. Since these vessels were built in\ndifferent shipyards for different roles and with different\nsystems requirements, they varied widely in their\nequipment, fit, and finish. As they were brought into\nmilitary service, they were given extensive refits at the\nMon Calamari Shipyards that included stiffening their\nkeels, adding armor, upgrading sensors and shields,\nconverting internal spaces into hangars, upgrading\nlaunch facilities providing berthing for more crew and\ntroops, and adding more powerful weapon systems.\nThese refits also brought a certain amount of commonality\nto each vessel, allowing them to be grouped into a\nsingle type with Home One as its lead vessel.\n[P]Similar in size, strength, and role to the Imperial\nNavy’s Imperial //-class Star Destroyers, the Home\nOne type is quite an imposing vessel. While ships\nof this type still vary slightly in size and shape, they\ndo share many common design cues and possess\nthe same quasi-organic look as other Mon Calamari-\nbuilt ships. Each vessel in the class has a long,\ncylindrical hull tapering to a point at the bow and flaring into a flat fantail at the stern. Weapon batteries and sensor arrays are placed around the hull at strategic points, protected by long, armored blisters. Two massive hanger bays are mounted amidships, and thrust is provided by four massive m8.0-StarDrive and six M4.5-StarDrive ion drives mounted astern below the fantail. While the addition of the heavier hill plates and improved armor does not spoil the ships' graceful lines completely, it does give them a bulky, almost humpbacked appearance.\n[P]Precious few of these ships are currently in service with the Alliance Navy, and High command jealously guards those that are. They are rarely deployed without a heavy escort of smaller cruisers and carriers, and orders are typically given that they are to stay at the rear of an engagement, protected from enemy fire. These orders don't stop bold commanders like Ackbar from running their ships directly into Imperial Navy formations, however. Their powerful weapons and large fighter wings can quickly turn the tide of a battle and their mere presence serves to inspire Alliance personnel, thanks to the grit and bravery of their Mon Calamari crew.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 53 - Lead by Example[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":9,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":155,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":90,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":4,"port":4,"starboard":4,"aft":4,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Long","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1200,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":85000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":112000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"MC80A Home One Type Heavy Star Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Unlike the iconic saucer shaped ships that typically come from CEC's shipyards, the 929 series is a hard-edged, slab-sided ship described as a \"flying brick\" by those familiar with it. It carries a wide array of laser and ion weaponry, as well as a powerful concussion missile launcher, and its shields are exceedingly powerful for a ship of its size and class. Its large, powerful drives provide immense thrust, propelling the ship to speeds surprising in so bulky a ship, and its cargo holds are relatively vast despite all of the military-style systems. \n\n[P]A number of these vessels have fallen into Alliance hands, where they are used as blockade runners and fast transports.

Sentinels have also made use of them in tracking down lawbreakers and patrolling the outer edges of the galaxy.\n[P]These small vessels cut a striking figure in the spacelanes. They have a broad, half moon-shaped hull reminiscent of a sea creature. They carry little in the way of armor and shields, and mount only a pair of light laser cannons for defense. The cockpit is straight from a [I]Delta[i]-class fighter and sits forward on top of the hull, giving the pilot an excellent view. The flat side of the hull faces aft and is dominated by a pair of powerful KSE L1011.a fusial thrust ion engines that provide immense amounts of thrust, moving the little ship through space at a respectable pace. A long, tapering spar extends aft between the engines, providing stabilization in atmosphere and carrying a sensor suite.\n[P]While these ships were once common, especially in the Core region, [I]Limulus[i]-class couriers are a rare sight in today's spacelanes.

The Aethersprite was designed to replace the aging Delta-6 in military, paramilitary, and private defense forces. Like its Delta-6 forebear, the Delta -7 has a long, narrow, arrowhead-shaped hull with two forward-mounted medium laser cannons and an aft-mounted cockpit with bubble canopy. Longer than the old Sprite interceptor, the Aethersprite features more powerful engines, better maneuvering systems. a higher-resolution sensor suite, and improved targeting and life support systems. The most dramatic evident change is the inclusion of an astromech droid to handle fire control and hyperspace navigation duties. The droid allows the Delta-7 to interface with the Syliure-31 hyperspace docking ring, giving the tiny ship good medium-range hyperspace capabilities. \n[P]From the outset, the Delta-7 showed excellent promise as a light interceptor and reconnaissance starfighter. Purchased in large numbers by the Republic Judicial Department and fielded by the Jedi Order, the Delta-7 quickly proved its worth.

Smaller and faster than SoroSuub's more popular Luxury 3000, the Luxurious-class ships were marketed toward aficionados of exclusivity and high performance. They possessed the singular, quirky charm common to Ghtroc products, and were, in their time, among the fastest and most finely appointed yachts in the galaxy. Each yacht was hand built from the keel up to the specifications of each owner. Ghtroc offered a dizzying array of options, allowing a buyer to hand pick everything from the ship's power systems to the fixtures in the captain's head. Luxurious-class yachts were especially popular among media moguls, professional ship racers, and sports stars. Even Raith Sienar himself owned one of these ships, a vessel rumored to be quicker than a TIE fighter and nearly indestructible. \n[P]Like other custom built starships, no two Luxurious-class are alike. That said, they do share a number of superficial similarities. Their hulls are relatively short and broad in the beam, and from above they resemble an oversized Y-wing starfighter.

A rarity in the Imperial order of battle, Lancers are armed with a number of accurate and deadly quad laser cannons that can fill every centimeter of space around them with crackling energy. Although frightfully effective, Lancers are expensive and have inordinately large crews. They are also a bit of a failed experiment, as with their light armament they can't take on ships of equal class, and their slow speed and poor maneuverability means that most fighters can simply outrun them. This, combined with the fact that most Imperial captains are happy to throw their TIE fighters away screening enemy fighters instead of filling a slot in their formation with a dedicated anti-starfighter vessel, means that the majority of Lancers currently in service are only active in and around the Outer Rim, where they fill interdiction and anti-piracy roles.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":52,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":34,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":40,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":200,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":4760000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Lancer-Class Frigate","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Quad Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Quad Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nQuad lasers are dedicated anti-starfighter-weapons consisting of four small-caliber laser cannons linked to a single firing mechanism and slaved to a sophisticated fire-control system.

The original ships were delivered to the CSA and recorded into the B.O.S.S. systems as freighters. The deception was eventually discovered, but correcting the designation proved problematic. Subsequent galaxy-wide updates often caused more confusion than clarity in the minds of law enforcement and other agencies. As the 4R3 was slowly delivered to other buyers and trickled out into the galaxy at large, in the minds of most it remained a freighter, if a heavily armed one. \n\n[P]The 4R3's main mission is as a clandestine assault ship. It is designed to look like an unarmed freighter in order to advance on and dock with enemy or pirate craft—before their opponents realize their mistake. The ship's weaponry is completely concealed within the ship's hull, and is deployed within a few seconds when required.

Designed by Alliance commander Gial Ackbar and produced by the Verpine shipbuilding consortium Slayn & Korpil, the B-wing is the largest, most heavily armed fighter in the Alliance arsenal. Relatively rare due to their high cost and complex design, these ships are also the most visually striking of the Alliance's fightercraft. They have a long, thin, blade-like fuselage that serves as a weapons platform with two small retractable S-foils that rotate around a heavily armored, ovoid pilot compartment. When deployed, they have a slim cruciform cross-section that, paired with their ability to rotate out of harm's way, makes them quite hard to hit despite their size. In combat, they spin like dervishes, their rotating hulls bringing their powerful weapons to bear on targets in an instant while the pilot stays still and correctly oriented in his capsule. They have a strange kind of grace that not even Imperial pilots deny. In their first few deployments, they carried the day as much through surprise and novelty as through their inherent fighting qualities; the Imperial pilots were often too stunned, or too wracked with laughter at these gangly fighters, to effectively fight back. \n\n[P]B-wings, like their older Y-wing cousins, are dedicated attack fighters. They are specifically designed to destroy capital ships and orbital installations using ion weaponry and heavy ordnance such as proton torpedoes and pro-ton bombs. They are heavily armored and shielded, and equipped with a quartet of heavy S&K sublight engines usually mounted on heavy gunboats and light capital ships. This gives them an incredible straight-line speed, especially given their great mass and awkward shape, and makes them extremely effective at their given mission. B-wings are still very rare in Alliance squadrons. They cost a mint of credits to build, are considered finicky maintenance hogs due especially to their surpris-ingly delicate gyro-stabilization system, and the Alliance has few pilots who can fly them effectively. Thanks to this, they are still an uncommon sight in Rebel formations Even so, their reputation precedes them, and the,. Imperial Navy knows that they're in for serious fighting when the Rebels bring B-wings to a fight.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":150000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"ASF-01 B-Wing Heavy Fast Attack Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Ion Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Ion Cannon[h3]\n\nIon weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets.

Known affectionately as the wishbone by its pilots, the Y-wing consists of a central fuselage section flanked by two drive nacelles mounted to reinforced pylons. The central section houses a heavily armored cockpit with full life support and pilot support systems, as well as all of the ship's weapon systems, with an astromech socket directly abaft. The Novaldex power generator, along with the fighter's shield generator, hyperdrive, and numerous other essential systems, is mounted amidships with engine nacelles on either side. Each contains a powerful Koensayr-produced R200 ion engine. \n\n[P]In keeping with their role as ship killers, Y-wings have thick armor and heavy shields to protect them while they close with targets. With their slim cross-section, sturdy protection, and powerful weapons, they are well suited to a role that requires them to fight their way to a target, deliver their ordnance, and fight their way back. Despite their reputation for reliability, Y-wings possess some quirks that make them relatively high maintenance. This has led to frustrated crews and technicians permanently removing the largely cosmetic hull plating for ease of constant access to the fighter's internal systems; it's a rare Y-wing that flies with its hull plates intact. \n\n[P]The BTL-A4 Y-wing is a single-seat variant, While the BTL-S3 has a second seat for a sensor officer/gunner behind the pilot. In the BTL-S3, the gunner fires the ion cannon turrets, while in the BTL-A4, they are fixed forward and controlled by the pilot. This profile covers both variants, as them are almost no additional differences.","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":4,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":80000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":4,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"BTL-A4 Y-Wing Attack Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Ion Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Ion Cannon[h3]\n\nIon weapons are anti-ship and anti-vehicle weapons designed to disable rather than destroy their targets.

They are effective pirate deterrents, and decent support vessels in larger fleets.

Introduced in the waning years of the Clone Wars, the Nighthawk was intended to replace the Y-wing as the Grand Army of the Republic's premier fighter/bomber. The final design resulted in a nimble, well-built ship that featured greater adaptability for wider mission profiles. However, the Clone Wars came to an abrupt end while the program was still in its prototype stage.\n[P]After the fall of the Republic, Koensayr was confident enough in its design to produce a handful of Nighthawks and attempt to sell them to the growing Imperial Navy. Unfortunately, Sienar Fleet Systems had already won a massive contract to produce the cheaper TIE-series of fighters for the Empire, and the Koensayr sales reps were turned away. Over the next few years, Koensayr produced the Nighthawk in limited numbers until eventually discontinuing the model around six years into the reign of the Emperor. Few of these forgotten fighters are in use today. Those ships that are still around soldier on in the hands of backwater planetary defense forces and private military concerns. A handful were recently discovered moth-balled at an old Koensayr warehouse, and after a thorough refit, they were offered on the open market. Alliance acquisition personnel immediately snapped them up; the starships disappeared after purchase and their whereabouts are currently unknown.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 61 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":5,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Short","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":124800,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"IE-440 \"Nighthawk\" Multi-Role Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Proton Torpedo Launcher","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Proton Torpedo Launcher[h3]\n\nProton torpedoes are highly advanced anti-ship projectiles typically carried by starfighters and patrol boats.

The Pathfinder-class reputation as a high-tech ship comes from both its advanced, sensor suite and the fact that it was one of the first mass-produced vessels of its size to feature hyperspace capabilities. Essentially oversized starfighters, Pathfinder scout ships carry two sentients seated abreast in a small, cramped, but well-laid-out cockpit. Directly abaft the cockpit is a small area with a refresher, a bunk, and a small storage area for ship's provisions and emergency supplies. Everything abaft the cockpit and rest area is packed with sophisticated long-range sensors, shield generators, and the powerful twin drive engines. \n[P]Lightly armed and armored, Pathfinders have defensive armament comprising a single turret-mounted light laser cannon atop the hull just abaft of the cockpit.

Sturdy, well-built, and over-engineered, they were designed to stand up to the rigors of constant interstellar travel, a type of shipbuilding that took surprisingly well to combat roles. \n\n[P]Beneath the graceful, rolling lines of their hull plates, these ships mount a frightful array of heavy weapons, and their firepower and thickly armored hulls have taken more than one Imperial battlegroup by surprise. In addition to their firepower, MC80 ships also carry up to ten squadrons of fighters, along with numerous shuttles, landing ships, and utility craft. Extremely powerful and versatile, they are also difficult to maintain, as they are all unique and there is hardly any component commonality between ships. This fact more than anything causes the Alliance to show caution in how and where they deploy these vessels, as each one is nearly irreplaceable.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":140,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":80,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":3,"port":4,"starboard":4,"aft":3,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":9,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":1200,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":104000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"MC80 Liberty Type Star Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Best described as tall and angular, these vessels have a long, narrow, slab-sided hull flanked by port and starboard sponsons that house the primary thrusters and sensor systems. Their prows are steeply angled wedges rising to tall super-structures that house the ships' powerful soliton-wave antennae, which can sense the comings and goings of other vessels in hyperspace, and their attendant cooling systems. Thanks to state-of-the-art slave-circuit systems, these vessels have a very small crew for their size and can operate at peak efficiency with only a handful of officers and crew. \n\n[P]The ship has some issues: the foremost that the sensor suite suffers from being mated to the finicky, high-maintenance soliton antenna and is prone to brownouts, spoofing, and signal interference. In addition, the soliton antenna drains power at a ferocious rate.

Ghtroc was well respected as a builder of high-quality freighters. The 720 class was seen by Ghtroc's designers as a way to corner the light freighter market in the Outer Rim and unseat the more successful offerings from its competitors. The ship carries a crew of two with accommodations for ten passengers. Two secure cargo holds take up the majority of the port and starboard midships space, with crew and passenger berthing forward abaft the extended bridge and command deck. The ship's reactor and engineering spaces are located amidships beneath a panoramic observation dome, a strange luxury in a freighter. The matched banks of GI/80.b Overthruster ion engines are housed in heavily armored nacelles in the bows of the ship, flanking the bridge as opposed to being mounted in the ship's stern. Combined with the angled aft escape-pod launchers, the freighter has a rather testudine appearance. \n\n[P]Although heavily armored, the 720 class is lightly armed. Equipped with a single turret-mounted twin light laser cannon, the weak armament is considered the most glaring deficiency in an otherwise well-constructed ship. Like most light freighters, the 720 class was designed with modification in mind. Indeed, most in operation today bear little resemblance to the ships that came off the assembly line at the Ghtroc shipyards.

The first prototypes of the ARX-T3-dubbed \"Suncutter\" for its crescent-like profile-were emerging from the assembly line in the first days of the Galactic Empire. As the Empire had decided to pursue a very different naval doctrine, it had no need for the expensive, yet fragile, hyperdrive-equipped interceptors. After Koensayr lost its contract, the ARX-T3 was produced only in limited numbers during a short run. In the years since, the Suncutter has gained considerable popularity among certain pilots who appreciate the craft's unique balance of defense, agility, and armament.

The forward quarter of the vessel contains the bridge, crew quarters, and primary systems. The remainder of the ship is given over to cargo space. Abaft the command decks is a hulking, multi-decked cargo hold equipped with countless sliding bulkheads, retractable decks, sophisticated anti-boarding systems, and a state-of-the-art cargo handling system. The two hull sections are, in fact, detachable, in case the ship is ever in danger of losing its cargo. Both the command section and the cargo hold are hyperspace capable. The forward section has a traditional hyperdrive and navicomputer, while the cargo section uses an automated emergency escape system that transitions it into hyperspace as soon as it is jettisoned, to keep it out of the hands of pirates. \n\n[P]Due to their size, durability, and heavy armament, Star Galleons are used by the Empire to transport high-value cargoes without needing escort vessels.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":1,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":85,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":18,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":2,"starboard":2,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":300,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":1500000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Star Galleon Armed Transport","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Designed by the team that would go on to build the Rebel Alliance's B-wing heavy attack starfighter, the Tempest is a large, flying wing style starfighter with a number of unique design elements. Like its B-wing successor, the core of the H-60 is a long, steeply angled, blade-like wing with a high-output reactor powering a quartet of powerful ion engines located amidships at the widest point of the fuselage. Unlike the newer, more advanced B-wing, the Tempest features two fixed-position cockpits, one mounted at each end of the central wing. The pilot controls the ship and its flight systems from the starboard cockpit, and the weapon systems engineer controls the various heavy weapon and bomb delivery systems from the port cockpit.\n\n[P]Heavily armored and featuring a sturdy, reinforced hull, the Tempest could absorb incredible amounts of punishment from both the environment and incoming enemy fire. Initially, the big fighter's armament consisted of a variety of laser cannons, ion cannons, and ordnance launchers combined with a ventral-mounted bomb bay. The bomb bay could carry a mix of guided and unguided dropped ordnance which was typically used against stationary positions, massed infantry or armor, and large, slow moving starships. While it showed great promise, a combination of bad timing and political wrangling within the dying Republic Navy quickly scuttled the H-60 program, and the entire line was discontinued after only a handful of squadrons were delivered. Those few remaining H-60s that survived the rise of the Empire were snatched up by the Rebel Alliance at a drastic discount after languishing in boneyards and on used ship lots for decades, and are currently seeing action throughout the Outer Rim with their younger B-wing cousins.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":22,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":172000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"H-60 Tempest Heavy Bomber","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Two additional fold-ing wings with an inverted gull wing design help stabilize the vessel. \n\n[P]Lambda-class shuttles are driven by two SFS-204 ion engines with an SFS S/ig-37 hyperdrive providing long-range capabilities. Incredibly well-armed for a shuttle, they are equipped with a number of laser and blaster cannons in both forward and aft hard points that give the ship good fire coverage. Instead of standard escape pods, the entire forward bridge section detaches from the hull as a lifeboat in case of emergency. Incredibly useful and surprisingly versatile for a military design, these ships are often the target of ship thieves and pirates and can, on occasion, be purchased at staggering cost from the black market.","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":25,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":15,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":20,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":200,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":140000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Lambda-Class T-4A Long Range Shuttle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Blaster Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Blaster Cannon[h3]\n\nKnown colloquially as \"flash cannons,\" blaster cannons are heavy, crew-served versions of the common personal blaster.

{"name":"TIE/PH \"Phantom\" Multi-Role Stealth Starfighter","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]TIE/PH \"Phantom\" Multi-Role Stealth Starfighter[h3]\n\nPerhaps the most terrifying and dangerous new TIE-series variant, the TIE/ph phantom is the first true stealth fighter fielded by the Imperial Navy. Produced in extremely limited numbers due to the cost and complexity of its systems, and assigned only to the most trusted and experienced Imperial Navy pilots for the same reasons, the TIE phantom is a heavily modified V38 assault fighter with an almost-unheard-of cloaking capability. A deadly-looking fighter. the phantom is a departure from the standard TIE-series design. The cockpit is a truncated cone similar to those found on CEC YT-series freighters, and it is mated to a heavily armored triangular hull that houses the fighter's engines, power generators, and stealth systems. Three TIE Interceptor-style solar collector arrays are arranged around the fighter's fuselage in a way that makes it resemble a Lambda-class utility shuttle. \n\n[P]Remarkably heavily armed, the phantom mounts five forward-mounted linked light laser cannons—three on the wingtips and two beneath the cockpit. In addition, the phantom is equipped with life support, a hyperdrive, shields, and numerous other systems unknown on other TIE variants, which is surprising enough given the Imperial Navy's order of battle and the value they place on their pilots. The most surprising system of all, however, is the recently rediscovered stygium cloaking device. \n\n[P]Banned by the Galactic Republic decades before the rise of the Empire, the production or use of cloaking devices using the rare stygium crystals from Aeten II was aggressively prosecuted by Republic authorities. With the fall of the Republic and the rise of the Empire, both the proscription on stygium crystals and interest in the cloaking technology itself waned. After the Battle of Yavin, however, the Empire began dredging up old ship designs and analyzing them for anything of value. During this mostly fruitless search, SFS engineers rediscovered the plans for a miniaturized stygium cloaking device that could be mounted in a starfighter or shuttlecraft, and they set to work Immediately perfecting this hypothetical device. Only a handful of TIE phantoms are currently in service. and while no one is sure exactly where they are stationed or by whom they are operated, the Rebellion has decided that despite their dangerous potential, the phantoms pose less of a risk to the Alliance than many other, more immediate Imperial threats.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":5,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":365000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":9,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"TIE/PH \"Phantom\" Multi-Role Stealth Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

{"name":"A-36 Pathfinder-class Force Recon Vessel","type":"vehicle","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","data":{"biography":"[H3]A-36 Pathfinder-class Force Recon Vessel[h3]\n\nEssentially an enhanced version of lncom's successful A-24 Sleuth-class scout vessel, the A-36 is designed for spacers who prefer direct action as opposed to skulking about and watching from afar. Using a batch of unsold A-24 hulls as a starting point, Incom stretched the hulls and enlarged the command deck, providing just enough space for a crew of four to operate the ship. \n\n[P]Along with increasing its size and crew capacity, Incom stripped most of the reconnaissance sensor suite out of the ships, replacing it with a long-range pin-point sensor array, a suite of more powerful weapons, and a sophisticated tracking/targeting/fire control computer. Extra armor was added to sensitive areas, the keels were strengthened, more powerful engines were installed, and a number of other systems were upgraded, hardened, and recalibrated to turn the ship from a passive scouting vessel to a fast, hard-hitting force recon ship. \n\n[P]The Pathfinder-class force reconnaissance ships retain the graceful, wasp-waisted silhouette of their A-24 predecessor. The command deck, while noticeably larger now, is still wrapped in photosensitive transparisteel sheets that give the crew a commanding view of their surroundings. Despite their upgrades and lengthening, Pathfinders blend in easily with their smaller, meeker A-24 cousins, a fact that organizations who keep both ships in their inventory use to great effect. \n\n[P]Aside from the obvious changes to the ship's length and bulk, the most notable item about the Pathfinder class is the sheer number of weapon systems that Incom managed to mount to them. In addition to the Taim & Bak laser cannons inherited from the original A-24, the A-36 carries a dorsal turret-mounted light repeating ion cannon on the midships section, giving it full command of the area around the vessel.

Ostensibly one of the many types of Star Destroyer, these multi-kilometer long vessels share more in common with the earlier Venator-class carriers of the Galactic Republic Navy than anything designed by Imperial Era KDY. Like all Star Destroyers, the Secutor-class has the instantly recognizable arrowhead-shaped hull with two gaping ventral hangar bays. Unique to this ship class is the command superstructure mounted amidships (rather than aft over the ion drives as it is on modern Star Destroyers), a feature that makes these big vessels stand out in ways beyond their size. \n\n[P]Derived from an earlier battlecruiser-class vessel, Secutor-class carriers are armed to the teeth with a wide variety of turbolasers, heavy ion cannons, ordnance launchers, and tractor beams. They are extremely heavily-armored and their shields can absorb a whole battlegroup's worth of damage with little effort. Within their cavernous hangars are two full wings of starfighters, 144 TIE-series fighters, and numerous shuttles and utility craft. In addition, Secutors carry the usual complement of Imperial Army walkers, troopers, armored fighting vehicles, and assorted materiel: enough to easily lay siege to a planet. While they are relatively rare in the modern Imperial Navy, Secutor-class carriers and their attendant battlegroups still have a distressing tendency to appear when least expected to lay waste to a Rebel stronghold or to provide support to a beleaguered Imperial Navy battlegroup.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-4,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":130,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":55,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":3,"port":3,"starboard":3,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":140000,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":28000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":200000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Secutor-Class Battlecarrier","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Designed to protect planets and important locations, the Golan I was developed during the Clone Wars to free up naval vessels for the war effort. While unable to contend with the overwhelming firepower of modern battle cruisers and Star Destroyers, the Golan I is more than a match for smaller capital vessels such as corvettes, frigates, and light cruisers, and its complement of starfighters and patrol ships can contend with starfighters and fast attack craft. \n\n[P]Since being surpassed by the larger, and much more heavily armed, Golan II and Golan III defense platforms (dozens of which can be found in orbit around Coruscant and other important Core Worlds), the Golan I has been largely relegated to protecting less critical planets and locations of secondary importance. The Imperial Customs Service acquired many of these space platforms, as well as several of their larger cousins, to serve as systems stations, coordinating operations for their ships and personnel across a wide area. Stationed in orbit around planets or along busy hyperlane routes, these stations monitor the flow of goods and traffic through their jurisdiction.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Fly Casual[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":0,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":300,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":150,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":2,"starboard":2,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":10000,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":26000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":9,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":40,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Golan 1 Space Defense Platform","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Indeed, starfighters were more of an afterthought in the Imperial order of battle rather than a primary means of projecting the Empire's force throughout the galaxy. Content to rely on large, imposing ships like the Victory-class Star Destroyers and the threat of overwhelming force, the Imperial Navy continued using fighters simply to screen larger vessels or to patrol Imperial-held star systems until an entire Imperial Navy battlegroup was completely annihilated by a handful of Rebel starfighters over Ton-Falk. In the wake of that embarrassing encounter, Admiralty opinion slowly began to change on the matter of starfighters. and the Ton-Falk-class escort carrier was born. \n\n[P]Vaguely resembling KDY's Super Transport-series container ships, Ton-Falk-class carriers are large, lumbering, boxy vessels with rounded edges and elongated fantails that extend aft over the massive ion drives. Equipped with the latest in fighter handling and traffic control systems, these ships are the smallest vessels capable of carrying a full flight of TIE-series starfighters—six squadrons of twelve ships each for a total of 72 fighters of varying models—along with all its attendant pilots, support staff, technicians, and equipment. Due to their light armament for a capital ship and the nature of their mission. these ships typically travel with a battlegroup of corvettes, frigates, and gunboats that provides fire support and screening for the carrier's starfighter operations. The carrier's powerful navicomputer and precision hyperdrive allow it to drop unexpectedly into a group of enemy ships with its smaller escort ships, quickly release its fighters while the frigates and gunboats distract the enemy, then jump again to another location while the fighters tear the enemy formation to shreds.

Built during the height of the Clone Wars, the Victory-class was designed as an all-purpose heavy line of battle ship meant to support planetary landings and take part in fleet actions. While considered fine ships at the time, they were rushed to production after many delays and political wrangling within the Navy and KDY, and the resulting ships required more maintenance and dry dock time than was considered right even in the heavily bureaucratic Republic. They suffered from a rash of problems (from burned-out hyperdrive couplings to a disturbing tendency to electrocute crewmen in their bunks) and the entire class quickly gained a reputation as unlucky ships and spacegoing coffins. When the Emperor ascended the throne and overthrew the Old Republic, the Victory-class ships were given a service life extension program, becoming the Victory //-class and promising increased combat performance and longevity and the elimination of all the old ships' problems. \n\n[P]This was not to be the case, however. Despite thorough rebuilds, the Victory II-class never eliminated all of its predecessor's issues. In addition, the development of new heavy cruisers and the Imperial and Imperial II-class Star Destroyers quickly rendered the old Victories obsolete despite their upgrades. Unloved by nearly everyone, many Victories were relegated to planetary garrison and light patrol duty in the farthest reaches of the Empire, and command of or assignment to one of the old Victories was seen as death to a Navy man's career.

While some are deployed with emergency services and hospital ships, most are run by freelance cybernetics doctors and technicians. Ships with legal cybernetics masters are well known in their areas of service. Their services run from basic cybernetic prosthetics to advanced post-injury reconstruction and enhancement. Legitimate operations tend to avoid installing cybernetics with blatantly criminal utility, such as concealed weapons or built-in lock-picking tools - or at the very least, they do not advertise such services.\n[P]For those seeking illegal modifications or illicit cutting-edge cybernetics, unscrupulous crafters of prosthetics offer the means, provided that the Player Characters can locate them. While such outfits might operate relatively openly on the fringes of the galaxy they are forced to keep a low profile in most civilized systems. Sometimes, these illegal operations provide cheaper installations or maintenance, at a higher risk of malfunction. Those running the operations are sometimes just as skilled as their legal counterparts, but poorly trained or incompetent operators can quickly botch an operation. A poorly run or indebted organization might provide the cheapest services, but its vessel workshop is often a dirty and unwelcoming house of horrors.\n[P]Cybershop ships usually originate from one of three types of vessels. The first is a hospital or emergency response ship - the conversion to its new function is relatively easy, but the ship might lack the defenses that outlaw cyberneticists may require. The second type of conversion begins with a maintenance support starship and adds medical bays and surgical suits as needed. This sort of operation caters to the cutting-edge providers who need a wider array of devices and technical resources to build and experiment with. Finally, the third type of conversion uses a ship that doesn't specialize in either field as a basis but this route is much more costly and labour-intensive. On the plus side, the owner can select a ship for its performance attributes and then modify it for the cybernetics business.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 63 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-2,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":50,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":25,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":2,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":2,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Long","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":100,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":1000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":1300000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Cybershop Ship (CR90)","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

The brainchild of General Jan Dodonna and former KSE engineer Walex Blissex, the RZ-1 is an evolution of two previous fighters: the R-22 Spearhead and the Clone Wars-era Delta-7 light interceptor. It is a lightweight, lightly-armed fighter capable of incredible straight-line speed as well as superior maneuverability, and it is every bit the match for the fast-moving Imperial fighters like the TIE/in and TIE/d. In practice, the A-wing is deployed to engage Imperial fast movers with its laser cannons and to harry smaller capital ships with concussion missiles while heavier fighters such as X-wings and B-wings deal with the larger Imperial fightercraft. It also makes for a very competent scout vessel and is equipped with data recording equipment and a powerful electronics countermeasures suite. \n[P]Dubbed \"the missile with a man in it\" by test pilots, the RZ-1 mounts twin Novaldex J-77 sublight engines, which produce enough thrust to move a ship many times the A-wing's mass. Coupled with a revolutionary hull pattern that combines inherently unstable design characteristics with a powerful flight control system, this tiny fighter can outpace and outmaneuver even the quickest enemy fighters. All of this speed and maneuverability comes at a cost, however. The ship is incredibly unforgiving to fly and requires intense concentration and high levels of prowess on the part of its pilots. It is also the most fragile fighter in the arsenal, having been designed to rely on its speed and agility to protect it.rather than armor plating or heavy-duty hull fittings.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":6,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":6,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":4,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":150000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"RZ-1 A-Wing Light Interceptor","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Light Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Light Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

Koensayr seeks to maximize profits through the combination of parts expertise and supply distribution system. One result of the union of skills is the AD-15 Modular Multi-Role Starfighter. It was designed around a standard selection of modules users can employ to adept the fighter as needed for different missions. Corporate designers believed that governments and militaries would like the economics of purchasing of one central chassis to build around, rather than paying for each task that might nor always be needed. Thus they developed the magnetic modular rail system that came to define the AD-15, which lets users rapidly equip new attachments.\n[P]Unfortunately, the cost to actually equip the fighter with components that meet military standards and Koensayr's noncompetitive lock on its proprietary parts and maintenance supplies diminished interest int he ship. However, the AD-15 found some success as a defender on board corporate and exploration starships with limited hanger space, where its multi-mission capability became an asset. A starfighter of otherwise average capabilities, the AD-15 has always been more popular with Technicians than pilots. Its adaptable nature makes it very easy to swap in and out custom-made modules, many of which are scratch-built by enterprising owners. Despite Koensayr's attempted monopoly on the parts, many Technicians have found and modified similar products that work just as well with the ship's magnetic modular rails, if not better.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 62 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":3,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":5,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":8,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":0,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":0,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":25000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"AD-15 Modular Multi-Role Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"AD15MOD"}},"_id":"wkd34usGeAdWwgHh"}

Long and sleek, the IR-3F is a short-range patrol craft designed for intra-system picket and customs duty. Fitted from the shipyard with a high-output power system and powerful sublight engines usually fitted to larger, cruiser-sized vessels, these ships had a reputation for blistering speed and relatively good maneuverability for vessels of their size. This, along with limited atmospheric capabilities, gives the IR-3F-class a well-deserved reputation as a dangerous and hard-to-elude ship, especially when handled by a competent crew. \n\n[P]While its speed and maneuverability are certainly respectable, this ship also carries a flexible and powerful array of weapons. Armed with a combination of medium laser cannons and light turbolaser batteries, the IR-3F-class punches well above its weight, allowing it to engage and defeat opponents considered impossible for a ship of its size. \n\n[P]It is lightly armored, a compromise made to wring more speed out of the vessel, but its Novaldex shield systems are quite robust and make up for any deficiencies in its armor. If this ship has a major flaw it is that, being designed as short-range craft, it has no hyperdrive or navicomputer. In addition. Its power and computer systems are designed in a way that makes retrofitting these systems quite difficult.

After the Clone Wars and with the rise of the Galactic Empire, the T-6 shuttle fell out of favor; many were moth-balled or relegated to the scrap yards of the Core Worlds. However, some few still saw service, especially in the Rim systems and other out-of-the-way locations.\n[P]The most familiar aspect of the old T-6 shuttles today is the cockpits, which have been repurposed for use on the A/SF-01 B-wing starfighter. The semicircular hull of the shuttle's main body, containing a small, cramped passenger compartment and what limited storage the shuttle possesses, rotates around the cockpit in a manner similar to the rotation of the hull and wing assembles of the B-wing.\n[P]The attributes that made the T-6 shuttle ideal for the Jedi still lend it to certain uses today. With its precision handling, speed, and incorporated armor, this small ship can safely and quickly convey important sentients to their destination, no matter what obstacles stand in their way. There have been reports of unsanctioned private, corporate, and system negotiation teams using old T-6 shuttles to operate beneath the Empire's watchful eye.

Perhaps the most popular of this small line of transports is the massive, lumbering Xiytiar-class heavy transport. Relatively new and uncommon, the Xiytiar-class ships are sturdy, cavernous cargo haulers equipped with the very latest in navigation, hyperdrive, and load-management systems. \n\n[P]Roughly the same size as Mobquet's Mb-C1 class of heavy transports, these haulers are among the quickest ships of their type both in realspace and hyperspace. Due to their size, high crew requirements, and the cost of maintaining these mammoth vessels, the Xiytiar-class ships are not particularly well suited for small private commercial concerns or smuggling operations. They are, however, gaining acceptance among larger, more established transport and trade companies that can absorb their operating costs and use their speed and hauling capacity to their fullest extent. \n\n[P]The ship itself is shaped rather like a piece of sporting equipment, with a large, bulbous forward section connected to the aft engine and engineering section by a thin, cylindrical midships section. The forward section houses the command deck, the crew quarters, a \nfew passenger berths, and the cargo holds. The holds are efficiently and intelligently laid out and are managed by a sophisticated lading system that tracks and inventories cargoes. \n\n[P]The midships section is largely machine spaces, sensor arrays, kilometers of cable, and a cramped walkway connecting the forward and aft sections. The engine and engineering section contains the majority of the power-generation and drive systems, along with the main computer bus and the shield generators. While these ships are highly mission focused with not much room for aftermarket modifications, particularly ingenious operators can squeeze a few weapons into the hull for defensive purposes or lay a little more armor over the midships section should they feel the need.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":2,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":35,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":20,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":1,"starboard":1,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":12,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":2000,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":200000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Xiytiar-class Heavy Transport","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[],"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"XIYTIAR"}},"_id":"y2XpReSbhzA4Cnio"}

A powerful, capable, easy to fly starfighter, the X-wing combines speed and hitting power into a potent package. These new fighters were brought into the Alliance Fleet to replace the aging Koensayr Y-wings and to provide more versatility in starfighter operations for Alliance commanders. Designed by Rebel sympathizers within Incom's fighter design bureau, these ships were acquired by the Rebellion after a daring raid orchestrated by Alliance intelligence and Incom executives on a lightly guarded Incom test facility netted the Rebels not only two full squadrons of brand-new fighters, but also the plans for building them. The blueprints were immediately disseminated to numerous shipyards under Rebel control, and production started within weeks of the raid. \n\n[P]X-wings are a true multi-role fighter, extremely effective in numerous missions from reconnaissance to attack to ship-to-ship dogfighting. With its four powerful Incom 4L4 engines and advanced avionics, the X-wing is more than a match for the Imperial TIE fighters, and its loadout of four linked T&B laser cannons and proton torpedo launchers makes it a serious threat to gunboats and small capital ships, especially when X-wings are deployed in large groups. In large battles, the X-wing acts as an escort fighter, keeping enemy fighters away from slower-moving attack fighters and bombers and protecting the precious Alliance capital ships. Thus far, the X-wing has proven to be an incredible asset to the Alliance. Some Rebel tacticians suggest that it is the game changer the Alliance needs to succeed against the Empire. Thanks to its numerous high-profile victories in its short service and to the daring way in which it was acquired, the X-wing has quickly become a symbol of Rebel ingenuity, resilience, and fighting spirit.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":5,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":1,"port":0,"starboard":0,"aft":1,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"None","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":10,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":120000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":5,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"T-65B X-Wing Starfighter","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Medium Laser Cannon","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Medium Laser Cannon[h3]\n\nThe standard anti-ship weapon mounted to starships, laser cannons are found on nearly every class of ship from the smallest starfighter to the mightiest capital ship.

At the time of their introduction,\nthe Maelstroms were the largest, and arguably\nmost impressive, vessels in the Republic Navy. Armed\nto the teeth and heavily armored, they were optimized\nfor fleet command duties, with additional fleet carrier\nand planetary siege capabilities. They carried an\nentire wing of starfighters—1 20 ships and their attendant\nsupport staff and facilities—and a full army of\nclones with weapons, vehicles, and assorted gear, and\nthey were equipped with sophisticated command and\ncontrol systems that granted the ship’s Commander a\nnear-limitless view of the theater of command.\n[P]Along with their impressive complement of starfighters\nand ground forces, the Maelstroms carry a staggering\namount of firepower to operate in their planetary\nbombardment role. They mount various multibarrel\nturbolaser batteries in both broadside turrets and\nfixed forward emplacements. Smaller, lighter weapons\nand torpedo launchers provide anti-starfighter and\nanti-gunboat fire for those small ships that slip through\nthe Maelstrom's prodigious fighter screen. The showpiece\nof the vessel’s armament, however, is its array\nof heavy assault concussion missile launchers, used for\nplanetary bombardment and anti-space station operations.\nWith their thick armor and powerful shields, the\nMaelstrom-class ships were incredibly tough nuts to\ncrack, and they fulfilled their roles very well.\n[P]Unfortunately, for the Maelstrom-class ships and their\ncrews, at least, these vessels proved unpopular and\nwere phased out of use soon after their introduction. By\nthat time, the Clone Wars had entered their final phase.\nNewer, faster ships were coming out of KDY, including\nthe innovative Victory-class vessels, and the Maelstroms\nwere never really deployed in their intended\nroles. They required a massive amount of resources to\nkeep running and were generally seen as too expensive\nto operate, despite their vast power. Maelstrom,\nthe lead ship of the class, served with distinction at the\nBattle of Kromus and the Battle of Cularin under the\ncommand of Jedi general Darrus Jeht, but most of the\nothers never saw combat. Eventually, with the end of\nthe Clone Wars and the rise of the Empire, bringing with\nit a reorganization of the Navy, the Maelstroms remaining\nin service were either broken up, used as technology\ntest beds, or laid up in mothballs. A handful of these\nmothballed ships still exist, and at least one of them,\na scarred old warhorse named Simoom, has found a\nhome in the Alliance Navy.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 57 - Lead by Example[h4]","attributes":{},"stats":{"silhouette":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Silhouette"},"speed":{"value":0,"max":1,"type":"Number","label":"Speed"},"handling":{"value":-3,"type":"Number","label":"Handling"},"hullTrauma":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":125,"label":"Hull Trauma"},"systemStrain":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":65,"label":"System Strain"},"shields":{"fore":3,"port":2,"starboard":2,"aft":3,"label":"Shields"},"armour":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Armour","adjusted":0},"sensorRange":{"value":"Long","type":"String"},"crew":{},"passengerCapacity":{"value":15000,"type":"Number","label":"Passenger Capacity"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"min":0,"max":12500,"adjusted":0},"cost":{"value":158000000,"type":"Number","label":"Cost","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"isrestricted":false,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0},"customizationHardPoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","adjusted":0},"hyperdrive":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Hyperdrive"},"consumables":{"value":1,"duration":"months","type":"Number","label":"SWFFG.Consumables"}},"itemmodifier":[],"itemattachment":[]},"token":{"name":"Maelstrom-Class Battle Cruiser","img":"icons/svg/mystery-man.svg","displayName":0,"actorLink":false,"width":1,"height":1,"scale":1,"mirrorX":false,"mirrorY":false,"lockRotation":false,"rotation":0,"alpha":1,"vision":false,"dimSight":0,"brightSight":0,"sightAngle":0,"light":{"alpha":0.5,"angle":0,"bright":0,"coloration":1,"dim":0,"gradual":true,"luminosity":0.5,"saturation":0,"contrast":0,"shadows":0,"animation":{"speed":5,"intensity":5,"reverse":false},"darkness":{"min":0,"max":1}},"disposition":-1,"displayBars":0,"bar1":{"attribute":"wounds"},"bar2":{"attribute":"strain"},"flags":{},"randomImg":false},"items":[{"name":"Heavy Turbolaser","type":"shipweapon","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Heavy Turbolaser[h3]\n\nMassive, heavy-caliber weapons with incredible energy requirements, turbolasers are the largest weapons mounted to starships.

Based on the TIE/sa tactical bomber spaceframe, the TIE/it frame packs almost four times the ordinance of its predecessor. Capable of unloading their huge payloads while weathering enemy fire, TIE interdictors have proven themselves indispensable to the Imperial Navy as they hunt down and crush various Rebel bases sprouting up around the galaxy. \n\n[P]Given the price of the weapons systems on board, and the loss of maneuverability, TIE interdictors have sturdier defenses than other ships in the TIE series. While they are not equipped with hyperdrives, TIE interdictors do posses shield systems to ensure their payloads make it to their destinations. Their armament consists of the standard forward-mounted light laser cannons and two linked sets of launchers capable of firing either concussion missiles or proton torpedoes (depending on the mission).

They are massive cylindrical stations festooned with docking arms, dry dock facilities, and boarding airlocks and studded with countless sensor and communications arrays. These floating shipyards can service nearly any ship currently in service, up to and including gigantic vessels like the Imperial Navy's [I]Executor[i]- and [I]Praetor II[i]-class ships. Most of the Mk IX series' production and fabrication facilities are automated to improve speed and efficiency, but the stations still have a large crew of technically trained personnel and other personnel who maintain the station and service incoming ships. The depot's guest facilities are comfortable but far from luxurious; crews tend not to linger, as they resemble military barracks and facilities rather than resorts.\n[P]These stations are impressively armored and shielded, and are also equipped with a respectable weapons load-out to defend against hostile ships. They also have hangar facilities and are commonly assigned a squadron of gunboats for patrol and anti-fighter duties. These stations are rarely attacked, however, since they are often surrounded by powerful warships waiting to dock or fresh off a refit, and these can provide all the defensive firepower that a station's crew could hope for.
