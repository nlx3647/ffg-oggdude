{"name":"Republic Representative","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Republic Representative[h4]\nResolving the conflicts of thousands of civilizations across the galaxy is a colossal undertaking, yet the Galactic Senate takes that as its function. The Senators who debate and negotiate within the Senate rotunda represent entire planets or corporate organizations; each Senator is a single voice speaking for millions. Yet, in representing such a massive constituency it is almost impossible for one person to balance the needs of the myriad smaller groups within the whole. For this reason, many worlds have one or more Republic Senate representatives, sometimes known as junior representatives, nonvoting members of the Senate who represent a minority political party or species. Representatives work closely with Senators as a delegation, to better represent the interests of a planet's entire population. Republic Representatives are expert politicians in their own right , working with each other and their world's Senator to determine what problems—or solutions—they should collectively bring before the Galactic Senate.\n\n[H4]ENVOYS IN THE ROTUNDA[h4]\n\n[P]The retinue of a Senator is, in many ways, like a miniature Senate of its own. Because no Senator can be familiar with all of the diverse cultures they represent, the many junior representatives who work with them stand in as the voices of their constituents. Each representative is sent to represent a distinct population or political coalition. A representative must be a master of diplomacy to ensure that their constituency's issues are taken seriously by the rest of their delegation, and they must be adaptable enough to retain the favor of their Senator and their political allies. Although a representative does not hold the power to vote or introduce legislation—except when fulfilling a Senator's duties during that Senator's leave of absence—they can sit on committees, and they receive all the same briefings as a Senator.\n\n[P]To succeed in the Senate, a character with the specialization receives [B]Charm, Cool, Knowledge (choose any one),[b] and [B]Negotiation[b] as additional career skills. When a character takes this specialization the player chooses one Knowledge skill appropriate for the group the character represents to become a career skill. The Senate is a stressful and dangerous place, full of competing interests and shifting loyalties. The ability to keep one's head when being rebuked by a Senator is highly sought after, as is a composure that betrays no hint of betrayal when a political alliance is going sour.\n\n[P]A Senator's responsibilities keep them on Coruscant much of the time, while those of a Republic Representative often take them away from the Senate. As an intermediary between their homeworld and the heart of the Republic, a Republic Representative is often among the stars, visiting the people of their world or carrying out assignments for the Senator. They tend to be more worldly than the full Senators of the rotunda, and most develop a wide network of associates among the less politically active communities of their homeworld.\n\n[P]However, when a Senator has to step away from Coruscant for any reason, they appoint a highly regarded Republic Representative to act as their proxy and rake on all the roles and responsibilities of a full Senator in the interim. This is often seen as a mark of high esteem and a first step toward inheriting the position from the current Senator when their term ends.\n\n[P]As they are politicians, Republic Representatives rarely train in martial techniques. The intrigues of the Senate are complex enough that mastering its intricacies is a lifelong undertaking. Furthermore, the tenets of the Republic are ones of peace and democracy rather than strength and valor, so peaceful solutions are always preferred to violent confrontation. Truly skilled representatives don’t even need weapons to defend themselves, for the right words can defuse a dangerous situation. One might say that Republic Representatives are never truly unarmed—that their weapons are smooth charm and sharp critiques.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 33 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","attributes":{"79m8yn81uvey59gf":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"jytz74k3qqo1tae4":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"plnsnss5fzh9c5kc":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"33oc0lqeezwkwdv4":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"fbmipo0y67hlbm1h":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"3ncwok69jx7fwza5":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Leverage","description":"The character removes [SE] per rank of Leverage from their Cool and Negotiation checks[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 41 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"kyVJqCpWoJNtEEGx","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Kill With Kindness","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Kill with Kindness from all Charm and Leadership checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"QtzzTgVNnnjRrphd","attributes":{"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Leadership":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Respected Delegate","description":"Downgrade the difficulty of social checks made to interact with government institutions outside of homeworld a number of times equal to ranks in Respected Delegation[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 41 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"vTpKHdih93ZCnrBc","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Nobody's Fool","description":"May upgrade difficulty of incoming Charm, Coercion, or Deception checks once per rank of Nobody's Fool.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"R94udJt3yVpNQXv3","attributes":{},"links-right":true},"talent5":{"name":"Kill With Kindness","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Kill with Kindness from all Charm and Leadership checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"QtzzTgVNnnjRrphd","attributes":{"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Leadership":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}},"links-right":true},"talent6":{"name":"Respected Delegate","description":"Downgrade the difficulty of social checks made to interact with government institutions outside of homeworld a number of times equal to ranks in Respected Delegation[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 41 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"vTpKHdih93ZCnrBc","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent7":{"name":"Smooth Talker","description":"When first acquired choose 1 skill; Charm, Coercion, Deception, or Negotiation.

Their shields and armor—for starfighters that have either—offer virtually no resistance to the weapons of the capital ships they oppose. Instead, they must trust in the Force to protect them as they launch their daring assaults. Those who embrace the risks of space combat may pursue the Starfighter Ace specialization.\n\n[P]Starfighter Aces acquire [B]Astrogation, Gunnery, Mechanics,[b] and [B]Piloting (Space)[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These provide the essentials needed to successfully pilot a starfighter in combat. Force adepts who acquire these skills most often control single-passenger craft, in which they must assume responsibility for weapons at the same time that they handle navigation.\n\n[P]While this style of combat is dependent on a vehicle, it remains physically exhausting. Even with a full range of technological enhancements, effective pilots must be capable of enduring rapid and extreme shifts in velocity and direction.

{"name":"Arbiter","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Arbiter[h4]\n\nAn Arbiter knows that often, no matter how hopeless a situation appears, a path to enlightenment and balance can be achieved through perseverance and negotiation. An Arbiter channels the nonviolent tendencies of the Consular into active negotiation between potential allies who have fallen into conflict through misunderstanding or nefarious influences. Through an understanding of sentient nature and the ebb and flow of conflict, an Arbiter can often pave the way for a group in the face of the most violent opposition.\n[P]The additional career skills for an Arbiter are [B]Knowledge (Xenology), Lightsaber, Negotiation,[b] and [B]Perception[b]. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may gain one free rank in two of these skills without spending starting experience. The career path of a Consular is a wide and varied one leading in such directions as those of the healer, student, or mystic. The Arbiter has chosen the path of the negotiator and peacemaker, following an innate impulse to seek peace and balance in the heated atmosphere of conflict and confusion. An Arbiter is able to stand between two foes, see to the heart of the conflict between them, and bring calmness and reconciliation to the situation.\n[P]Arbiters are born negotiators. Whether fully aware of their Force powers or not, they tend to find themselves following the career paths of diplomats and mediators, seeking to bring peace to the galaxy. Some Consulars work with the Rebel Alliance, finding like-minded societies and bringing them into the Rebel fold or helping them to overcome Imperial pressure. However, many do their work in secret, laboring with a wide variety of corporations, organizations, and other groups to help bring harmony and tranquility to a wartorn galaxy. Arbiters see the ebb and flow of pressures and struggles and instinctively sense the fault lines of thought and belief that perpetuate the violence and conflict bred by miscommunication and misunderstanding. Arbiters seek to bring balance to the galaxy through negotiation and reconciliation.\n[P]The Arbiter understands the importance of calmness, respect, and tact while dealing with a diverse array of possible allies and potential enemies. Although many, when confronted with injustice or intransigent negativity, might reach for their lightsaber, an Arbiter's first recourse will always be discussion and negotiation. When the local situation looks completely hopeless, when ancient grudges or new transgressions threaten to tear a system down into violence or chaos, an Arbiter will be able to find a path through the bedlam, to see a course of action that will restore peace and create an environment conducive to the prosperity and contentment of all.\n[P]An Arbiter is skilled in acting as the face of a group, providing an interface between the group and the authorities controlling its current area of operation. An Arbiter can assist her group with social interactions, negotiations, and acquisitions, opening doors that less diplomatic characters may find indelibly closed. The Arbiter must at all times keep in mind the greater scope of her duties. Peace is always the ultimate goal, but there is often a bigger picture that must be considered. And when the time for negotiation is at an end, even Consulars must be ready to use more direct means, no matter regretful they may be.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 22 - Disciples of Harmony[h4]","attributes":{"bv1ow8snubh1ixqk":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"5e62bdhcrmmygczn":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"tfcw3fpf2ebkwfad":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"aohbypw622jy8kk2":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4vgwlxoqm4c9nnbh":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"8o62dktnmsuk19h3":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Sense Emotions","description":"Add [BO] to all Charm, Coercion, and Deception checks unless the target is immune to Force powers.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"l44nXw8HTdGKbhBs","attributes":{"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Coercion":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Savvy Negotiator","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Savvy Negotiator from all Negotiation and Streetwise checks.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 -

{"name":"Ship Captain","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Ship Captain - Independent Leaders[h4]\nFor Ship Captains, their vessel and their crew are everything. Without them, captains are imprisoned in an incomplete existence. With both, they're free. To protect this freedom, they demand an unmatched excellence from everyone aboard and provide the kind of leadership that gets these results. If crew members aren't highly skilled when joining a crew, Ship Captains will push them to become so through inspirational words and leading by example. In exchange, crew members become a family and gain access to a wealth of camaraderie, connections, and experience.\n[P]The additional career skills an PC receives when taking the Ship Captain universal specialization are [B]Charm, Leadership, Negotiation,[b] and [B]Piloting (Space)[b]. Given a good ship and loyal crew, there is little this PC cannot accomplish.\n[P]Ship Captains captain ships. It's what they do and who they are. For most beings, investment in a vessel is an unfathomable dream. For Ship Captains, the lack of a vessel is an unbearable nightmare. Once they've tasted the freedom only a starship or wide-ranging skimmer can provide, it becomes impossible to return to a predictable life and a seemingly meaningless existence. Ship Captains control their own lives.\n[P]In order to live their dreams, Ship Captains rely on the contributions of an effective and close-knit crew. While they can find jobs and know the best places to sell goods, they aren't necessarily the finest of pilots, engineers, or fighters. When needed, they can always step in to fill a vacancy in order to escape pursuit, make a temporary fix, or shoot a blaster, but the best captains have specialists to fill these roles. Such specialists tend to travel with a single captain for extended durations. As captains and crews become comfortable with each other, all members learn how best to perform their key responsibilities and where they can most effectively support everyone else. For many, this professional arrangement acts as a surrogate family structure, with the captain as parent.\n[P]As surrogate parents, Ship Captains are responsible for keeping everyone in line and for pushing them to be their best. When there is a dispute between crew members, captains resolve it. When a decision needs to be made, captains make it, and when shipmates doubt their own capabilities in a moment of crises, captains instill them with confidence. Ship Captains themselves must be strong to earn the respect of their crews, but they cannot operate through strength and threats alone. If that strength can't be tempered with compassion, every crew member will eventually find reasons to leave.\n[P]This compassion is one reason why some captains rebel against the injustices of the Empire. For some of them, the Empire's human-centric policies are intolerable, as they view species, beliefs, and affiliations as largely irrelevant as long as shipmates meld with the rest of the crew and perform well. Many others see the tightening grip of the Empire as a threat to their independent existence. This threat can be even more pronounced in light of a captain and crew's past transgressions against the Empire.\n[P]Independent and driven to stay that way, Ship Captains are dangerous threats to the Empire. No matter what role, legal or otherwise, they may have had before they gained ownership and command of a vessel, they offer much to freedom fighters. With the capability to lead strikes with effectively supported crews, they give hope to and signal the possibility of a more powerful organized resistance. Wherever they are needed, Ship Captains can get there and inspire their crews to victory.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 108 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{"0wvq7xrp4sno3koq":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"r6at3df73zlplk81":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4a8ic0qu0db8a3x9":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ah5s6xds1mdr71su":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"s5ttztl8xuiefh95":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"d1v7ym548eqv26q9":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"i3ycs40naraqrt5e":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"cme9vv2422g5smcp":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Wheel and Deal","description":"When selling good legally, gain 10% more credits per rank of Wheel and Deal.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 145 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 159 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"OOFiieNcAoWdGgpF","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Pride and Joy","description":"Choose one starship or vehicle character owns with a silhouette or 4 or higher; it becomes his 'Pride and Joy' vessel.

{"name":"Magus","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Magus - Following a Different Path[h4]\nTo hear of a Magus, even during the time of the Galactic Republic, would be a rare event; to meet one, even more so. The Jedi Order, in its waning days, had become quite conservative regarding explorations into the Force. The Jedi either avoided or outright fought the myriad of sects and cults exhibiting mystical powers throughout the galaxy. The Force, they reasoned, was all they needed. Other teachings and experiments deviated too much from the clear path of the Jedi and thus danced too close to illusion and self-deception, leading to temptations toward the dark side of the Force.\n[P]Paradoxically, a Force user may be more likely to become a Magus during the Galactic Civil War. With hope and the light in short supply, some disciples may be more open and willing to seek out so-called forbidden knowledge. A Magus develops and collects a hodgepodge of strange rituals and odd practices to commune with the Cosmic Force. They have no training, but at the same time, they have no teachings that would convince them not to try. The danger, of course, comes from a lack of oversight. Without a guiding hand or proper self-reflection, a Magus has a greater chance to experiment with powers fueled by the dark side of the Force.\n[P]The Magus receives [B]Coercion, Discipline, Knowledge (Lore),[b] and [B]Medicine[b] as additional career skills. When starting with this specialization, the Magus may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each.\n[P]Knowledge, especially forbidden knowledge, fuels the Magus. Unrestricted by the Jedi Order, defiant of the Galactic Empire, the Magus seeks a connection to the Force through knowledge. The source of that knowledge doesn't matter; rituals, objects and places of power, and ancient religious and magical texts all hint at a singular source of energy. While some Magi crave knowledge for its own sake, most explore the Magus path in order to control the Force itself.\n[P]If the Force flows through everything and is a part of everything, then by manipulating the Force, the Magus can manipulate reality. The Force can be used to make matter, affect matter. affect life. and perhaps...even create life. With this power, the Magus can do amazing and impossible things. No, not impossible, for nothing is impossible if one believes in the Force.\n[P]This confidence, however, is the biggest trap for Magi. They can do impossible things, yes, but it is the Force that allows them to do so, not their knowledge or talent. Despite what they may think, Magi still have mortal trappings. They have histories, memories, early thoughts, and emotions that can never be truly removed. Hubris may be the greatest enemy for Magi. This hubris can trick Magi into thinking that pushing here or pulling there might be for the good of all, or for the good of the Force, but in reality, they are manipulating the Force for their own selfish needs. Many a Force-using tyrant became a Magus before falling to the dark side.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Unlimited Power[h4]","attributes":{"mq1oe62mgukba7en":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"rcomdp1zbkamag69":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"5aqaqbi4k9mgct1h":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"s6eyipsrcyg4h3xt":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"cdool0e8nsn9tx9b":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"e5p0csn66dpgym1f":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Healing Trance","description":"Commit [FO].

{"name":"Advocate","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Advocate - Kingmakers[h4]\n\nNot all politicians contribute to the cause through stirring speeches to win the hearts and minds of the public. Part political strategist and part counselor, the Advocate uses argumentation and insight to expose the flaws in political opponents and accentuate the best qualities of allies. A skilled Advocate turns the words of a foe back upon him or rephrases a friend's thoughtless comment, casting it in a positive light. Backed by an Advocate, even a political novice can become a force to be reckoned with, and a truly skilled politician can soar to untold heights of power and influence.\n\n[P]To assist with his unique political role, the Advocate receives the [B]Coercion, Deception, Negotiation,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] skills as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills, gaining one free rank in each without spending starting experience. These skills reflect an Advocate's need to remain alert at all times, and his tendency to undertake tasks others might find onerous or unethical. Vigilance helps an Advocate determine when a situation is growing dangerous, while Coercion is crucial to badgering opponents into backing down once the Advocate has the right piece of evidence in hand. more personable politicians. Others hurl themselves into the fray, undermining opponents with a solidly constructed argument or strengthening the rhetoric of political allies by subjecting it to the harshest scrutiny. A good Advocate can be a trusted mentor or a hated rival, and a great Advocate knows how to be either one as the situation demands.\n\n[P]Advocates work best within a group, either backing up a skilled speaker or elevating a less experienced but more personable character to act as the faction's public face. While an Advocate can apply pressure effectively, his greatest potential is in the role of a mentor or manipulator, directing other, more visible actors.\n\n[P]A veteran Diplomat might want to take Advocate as a second specialization after investing heavily in interpersonal skills, combining the rhetorical skills of another specialization with the Advocate's emphasis on applying pressure to get results. Alternatively, a Soldier, Spy, or other character with a more combat-oriented focus might find the Advocate helpful as a secondary specialization, enabling that character to more effectively contribute to social encounters.\n\n[P]An Advocate benefits greatly from a high Cunning or Willpower characteristic. One who invests in both can be extremely flexible in social situations, filling the role of mentor, manipulator, mediator, or attack dog as the circumstances of the negotiation require.

{"name":"Retired Clone Trooper","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Retired Clone Trooper - Decommissioned Soldiers[h4]\nLiterally bred for battle, these warriors were the bulk of the Republic's fighting force in the Clone Wars. Exceptionally trained, they were invaluable allies to the Jedi Order until they were manipulated into betraying its members. As the clones' accelerated aging process continues unabated, their life spans are reaching their ends, but they remain effective, tactically minded warriors whom none should underestimate.\n[P]The additional career skills a PC receives when taking the Retired Clone Trooper universal specialization are [B]Discipline, Knowledge (Warfare), Ranged (Heavy), Ranged (Light), Resilience,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b]. Player Characters who take this universal specialization must be human males, given that they were once clone troopers, but gain a wider set of career skills from their Kaminoan training. Such PCs have seen too much of war, but realize that the Empire cannot be stopped unless they lend their skills to the battle.\nClone troopers were grown on Kamino using the human bounty hunter Jango Fett as their genetic template. These clones were engineered with an accelerated growth rate in order to become effective combatants in a significantly reduced period of time, and they had inhibitor chips installed to prevent unintended violent outbursts-or at least that was the official reason. While the troopers developed, they were given extensive generic combat training in addition to specific training as pilots, gunners, shock troopers, and a variety of other specializations. Possessing the ability for creative thought clone troopers were significantly more effective than the mass-produced, programmed droids they were sent to combat.\n[P]During the Clone Wars, clone troopers became battle brothers; after surviving countless battles together, they established a fierce loyalty not only for each other but also for their Jedi generals. Without the contributions of both clone troopers and Jedi, the Republic would have had no chance of winning. The bond appeared unbreakable to all.\n[P]Near the end of the war, though, Chancellor Palpatine branded the Jedi as traitors and ordered the clone troopers to eliminate their Jedi comrades, no questions asked-and they did. Almost no Jedi or Padawans survived. Soon afterward, due to their accelerated aging, the clone troopers were decommissioned and replaced with non-clone stormtroopers, who lacked their intensive training. Once retired, some clone troopers were horrified about their execution of Order 66. A few went as far as removing their inhibitor chip, blaming it for making them follow the order, since troopers who had removed it beforehand did not carry out the order.\n[P]Today, a handful of these soldiers still survive and grapple with the consequences for their actions. Whether due to shame for their role in Order 66, anger against the Empire, or a desire to continue to fight for their Clone Wars ideals, a few have abandoned their leisure to fight in this nascent rebellion.\n[P]Retired Clone Troopers are powerful allies despite their age. Not only do they retain their tactical combat knowledge and training, but they have striven to maintain their genetically imbued physical conditioning as well. This is enhanced by the practical skills derived from their years of fighting and winning battles. As former soldiers of both the Republic and the Empire, they also know the location of multiple abandoned military bases scattered across the galaxy.

{"name":"Force Adherent","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Force Adherent - Indomitable Believers[h4]\nForce Adherents worship the Force and accept its influence over the galaxy. The Force binds all living things, and those who surrender to this idea are able to reach a level of perception unknown to the common sentient. Even those without sensitivity to the Force have benefited from this acceptance. Through this belief, Force Adherents are capable of overcoming extreme adversity.\n[P]The additional career skills a PC receives when taking the Force Adherent universal specialization are [B]Melee, Discipline, Knowledge (Lore),[b] and [B]Vigilance[b]. Finding purpose and strength in their belief in the Force, such PCs are bastions of belief in these dark times.\n[P]Belief in the Force is most commonly associated with the Jedi legends, but multiple cultures throughout the galaxy recognize the same phenomenon. For example, the Lasat, whom many believe to be extinct, worship the Ashla, a personification of the light side of the Force, and acknowledge the Bogan, a personification of the dark side of the Force. Gand findsmen utilize techniques that outsiders view as directly related to the Force as well. For these cultures, the idea of the Force, however it is represented, is an accepted part of their identity. While it is natural for members from these groups to worship the Force, others from outside these cultures are drawn to Force worship as well.\n[P]For sentients seeking purpose, turning to the Force can provide guidance. Whether their seeking is triggered by a general sense of meaningfulness or a specific, personal loss, the idea of the Force is a reassuring constant. For these individuals, the rituals, practices, and holy places of Force worship give direction. Making pilgrimages to established Force locations like Jedha, for instance, is frequently an integral part of these Force Adherents' journeys. However, not all Force Adherents come to their worship for meaning or guidance.\n[P]To those who have seen or heard about the incredible deeds of Force-users, such as the Jedi, worship of the Force tantalizes with the possibility of unlocking that strength. Unfortunately for those who seek this power, not all individuals are sensitive to the Force. Regardless, those who pursue Force worship earnestly find a strength they can unlock within themselves.\n[P]By developing their understanding of the Force, Force Adherents become more in tune with the galaxy. Even if they cannot tap into the Force directly, they learn to listen to the life around them; where most sentients hear only noise, Force Adherents hear the spiritual call and response of the entire range of beings in the area, In addition, Force Adherents' meditative contemplation and training allow them to push their bodies past normal limitations. An unwavering belief in the providence of the Force can even eliminate fear of failure, because all is as the Force wills it.\n[P]Force Adherent's worship and training make them more-than-capable fighters, and their knowledge of the Force is practically unrivaled.

The enemy can pour thousands of stormtroopers and other forces into a meat-grinder of a battle, taking horrific casualties, without blinking an eye over its losses. Every soldier of the Rebellion is, on the other hand, a valuable asset whose loss Alliance High Command feels keenly. The Medic serves to prevent as many of those losses as possible.\n\n[P]Medics go into the field with [B]Knowledge (Xenology), Medicine, Resilience,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills; if this is the first specialization taken, two of these four begin with a free rank. Medics know how to keep their head when everyone else is panicking, and they know how to be prepared for any contingency. They are skilled at treating the wounds of anyone in their unit, regardless of species.\n\n[P]Many folks think Medics are inherent pacifists. While a Medic might prefer to save a life rather than take it, most realize the necessity of fighting and violence for a greater cause, and are more than ready to strike down an enemy in order to save a comrade. Medics tend to see no one as expendable, which can make them difficult to deal with when a commander wants to pull a team out of a situation and there's a chance any of those on the deck could still be alive.\n\n[P]The vast majority of Alliance troopers greatly revere the Medics in their units, knowing these brave men and women are often the only thing standing in the way between them and death.

{"name":"Droid Specialist","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Droid Specialist - Artificers for the Artificial[h4]\nLike battlefield surgeons working on organic soldiers, Alliance Droid Specialists focus on making their charges functional for combat but often must sacrifice perfection for practicality. A Core World droid factory may have the luxury to produce repairs that return a damaged droid to a like-new state. In the midst of horrific combat or in repair bays lacking proper resources, though, Droid Specialists can't be fancy. When faced with dozens of droids, having to stop and reassess a custom configuration not only slows the repair work, it complicates the job. At the end of the day, if their mechanical comrades are fit for another day of support and battle, then their mission is accomplished.\n[P]Droid Specialists receive [B]Computers, Cool, Mechanics,[b] and [B]Melee[b] as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Droids serve two purposes in the Alliance: to assist their organic counterparts and to integrate with computers and other data storage devices. Some Droid Specialists see themselves like the sergeants of a droid platoon, treating their inorganic soldiers harshly but fairly, sending them out into battle without hesitation, and working hard to ensure the droids have the programming and technology they need to come back. Others have a colder practicality. Repairing a damaged droid takes less time and resources than replacing or building a new one.\n[P]The topic of droid manumission remains a messy one. Various bases treat droids differently depending on their commander's attitude, the soldiers' attitudes, their morale, and the circumstances. Regardless, Droid Specialists tend to be protective of their inorganic soldiers. Whether it is because they recognize them as sentient beings or as valuable machines depends on the individual. The Alliance as a whole treats droids with more consideration and respect than the rest of the galaxy. Droid Specialists advocating on their behalf have contributed to this positive change.\n[P]Although the Rebellion receives equipment en masse, Droid Specialists can't count on consistency or quality. As supply lines and alliances change, so do their sources of parts and droids. As a result, Alliance droids tend to take on a patchwork look much like that of their Outer Rim counterparts. Rebel agents can often tell how well a base is supplied just by the droids: If they look clean and relatively uniform, the base is obviously well supplied. If the droids appear completely different from each other (and have personality quirks to rival a rogue Outer Rim droid), then the agent knows the base is in dire shape.\n[P]This is the difficulty most Droid Specialists face in Rebel outposts without a regular supply line. Organics tend to get the most supplies, followed by the machines of war: blasters, cannons, and starfighters. At the bottom of the ladder stand the droids, which must bear the brunt of rationed supplies while functioning to serve their organic commanders. Some Droid Specialists see this work as a punishment. Others come to identify with their charges.

In the time of the Republic. many Jedi peacemakers trained with the lightsaber to prepare themselves for that eventuality. Today, Consulars who wish to do the same can focus on self-defense and gain a working knowledge of lightsaber combat by following the path of the Niman Disciple.\n\n[P]Niman Disciples gain the additional career skills of [B]Discipline, Leadership, Lightsaber,[b] and [B]Negotiation,[b] and if this is the PC's starting specialization, the PC gains one rank in each of two of these skills. They remain focused on working with groups of individuals to come to a peaceful accord, but they acknowledge that the road to that accord may be fraught with danger. These skills can make surviving in a treacherous environment much more possible.\n[P]Due to Consulars' naturally compassionate nature, this path centers on developing defensive measures in concert with negotiation techniques. In general, the associated combat techniques are focused on survival and defense instead of attack. Also, due to the Consular's emphasis on mental discipline and self control, the Niman Disciple puts more emphasis on integrating his Force abilities into his fighting style, using the Force as his ally to defeat dangerous foes.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 70 -

If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience.

In combat, they are masters of dishing out and taking lots of damage.\n\n[P]Marauders may come from low-tech worlds, where advanced weaponry simply wasn't an option for them. Alternately, they might come from a culture where melee combat is considered far more honorable and worthy, and they keep to their traditions. Moreover, many pirates and raiders of starships favor melee weapons in order to avoid damaging vital systems aboard a ship they're in the middle of trying to take.\n\n[P]A character who chooses to be a Marauder might be an ex-pirate.

{"name":"Analyst","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Analyst - Connecting the Dots[h4]\n\nKnowledge is power, on the battlefield and in negotiations alike. The Analyst knows this (and a great many other things) better than anyone else. More importantly, the Analyst knows how to leverage such information to maximum effect, finding the trends and connections that turn otherwise meaningless facts into crucial intelligence that might someday decide the outcome of the Galactic Civil War.\n\n[P]The Analyst gains [B]Computers, Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Warfare),[b] and [B]Perception[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills, gaining one free rank in each without spending starting experience. These skills allow Analysts to not only parse and remember vast amounts of data, but also contextualize it in a way that makes the data useful. The Computers skill can be particularly valuable, allowing an Analyst to access archives and slice into communications systems to stay informed. The specialization's considerable access to Knowledge skills also allows an Analyst to know a bit about everything.\n\n[P]Some Analysts focus their attention on one specific topic, such as mastering Rebel Alliance codes tracking data on its units in the field, or monitoring Imperial activity in specific regions via the HoloNet. Others act as liaisons to political and military leaders, using their considerable research experience to provide any information their allies need.\n\n[P]Experienced Analysts are crucial to the diplomatic success of the Rebel Alliance. Many politicians and leaders look to Analysts for key support, and some even have a background in such work themselves. Knowing the unique customs of a local culture can be crucial to the success of a diplomatic mission, so an Analyst must have access to this information at a moment's notice. Analysts can be equally important on the battlefield, identifying troop-movement patterns that betray the foe's strategy or providing information about local environmental conditions so the Quartermaster can properly equip infantry. Wherever they serve, the knowledge and skills of Analysts save lives as surely as the choices of commanders and the hands of medics.\n\n[P]Analysts work best when they have the opportunity to exhaustively research a subject before going into the field, but the work of the Rebel Alliance sometimes requires its representatives to improvise. Therefore, Analysts—especially those attached to squads with specializations and missions as diverse as most PC groups—must be prepared to work on the fly. Even without access to data archives or the HoloNet, a skilled Analyst can effectively observe and break down a situation, identifying ways the squad can exploit vulnerabilities in enemy strategies and technologies.\n\n[P]An Analyst benefits from a high Intellect characteristic for making Computers and Knowledge checks to access and remember information. A high Cunning also assists Perception checks to spot critical details.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Desperate Allies[h4]","attributes":{"iwzsx7j12tr4msur":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"k6cqkb252b7r2g8o":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"5gtnfcsglx4pm420":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"1bxodzssiaz0rf8f":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Researcher","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Researcher from all Knowledge checks.

{"name":"Pathfinder","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Pathfinder[h4]\n\nFew are as capable of exploring a planet and discovering its secrets as a Pathfinder. The combination of Pathfinders' Force talents and their training enables them to quickly and precisely complete a search, even under the most adverse conditions. A Pathfinder can survive in a hostile wilderness for weeks or months, living off the land with minimal supplies and possibly a faithful companion animal. In fact, some Pathfinders are said to be able to bond with their companions through the Force, communicating with them mentally, seeing through their senses, and even directing their actions.\n[P]Pathfinders acquire [B]Medicine, Ranged (Light), Resilience,[b] and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These skills are focused on complementing the Seeker's career skills, so that the character becomes even more capable of operating independently. The addition of Medicine is primarily for personal benefit but can also be useful in aiding the character's companions.\n[P]Some Pathfinders follow this career because they discover they have a knack for independent survival. This is most commonly true for Force-sensitive Individuals who matured on primitive and uncivilized planets. If his small community was surrounded by hostile wilderness, a character is certain to have spent his youth exploring that environment—likely making friends with many of the wild animals present there. Pathfinders' natural abilities likely led them to a position of some responsibility within their tribe. Their roles might have included securing the safety of the surrounding wilderness and maintaining any trails leading to agricultural resources or other necessities needed by the community's residents.\n\n[P]Others who follow the Pathfinder career do so out of a preference for the company of animals over that of sentient beings. Through their Force abilities, some learn to establish effective communications with the relatively primitive minds. In these interactions, they find that they enjoy the sincerity and straightforward nature of wild creatures.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 89 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"jsumtd044l1vbc30":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"pzpx7ojg85czixi3":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"q5sa17cykgnzsiol":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"k5fqcmz1nu8v8wwx":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"vgvdmyj0zvpak2o4":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"q7msrejeuhxmjmgv":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"i2don8l7uw6hy27s":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"env75hgo9473sl6y":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Keen Eyed","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Keen Eyed from Perception and Vigilance checks.

{"name":"Force Sensitive Emergent","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Force Sensitive Emergent[h4]\n\nThe Rebel Alliance stands for the restitution of the values and structures that were set aside during the rise of Emperor Palpatine. As Force users have been among those persecuted under the Imperial regime, many of them sympathize with the goals of the Rebellion. As a result of this, one of the Rebel Alliance's most underestimated assets is a cadre of amateur Force-sensitives who could prove decisive in the struggle against the Empire. Or at least, they would be if they were properly identified and trained.\n\n[P]Within the ranks of Rebel organizations, Force-sensitives are safe from the Empire and have access to one of the few remaining societies in the galaxy that still openly acknowledges and encourages an understanding of the light side of the Force. While the Jedi Order has been shattered by the Empire, there are many within the Rebel Alliance who remember them and their teachings. While few Force-sensitives are ever fortunate enough to receive training from an actual Jedi, at least in the Alliance they can learn about the Order's traditions and techniques from sympathetic sources.\n\n[P]While they were regarded by the citizens of the galaxy as a benevolent order dedicated to the promotion of peace and harmony throughout the galaxy, the Jedi Knights also had a well-deserved reputation as fierce warriors, particularly when it came to close-quarters fighting with their signature weapon, the lightsaber. While few Force-sensitives hope to develop such prowess, or come to possess a lightsaber of their own, they do tend to develop some skill at martial arts. In fact, a little training in hand-to-hand combat is recommended, both as a method of self-protection and because the associated regimen is said to help put one in the right frame of mind to contemplate the Force.\n\n[P]The Force-Sensitive Emergent specialization does not have any career skills associated with it. When a character purchases this specialization, he automatically receives a Force rating of 1 (if he did not already have it). However, if the character already has a Force rating of 1 or higher, it does not improve when he purchases the Force-Sensitive Emergent specialization.\n\n[P]Just like other specializations, the Force-Sensitive Emergent specialization can be taken at character creation or at any subsequent point. This represents the fact that some Force-sensitives do not become aware of their potential until a relatively late stage of their lives.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 292 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"ctoug2gkd7kgx80g":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Insight","description":"Perception and Discipline become career skills.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"o0iK0PujCJXtDOLf","attributes":{"k0iieyi2q6p1wk72":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"rb6fsid7ohavzh2t":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true}}},"talent1":{"name":"Uncanny Senses","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Uncanny Senses to all Perception checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"DXUoFuMB2aVMhu4w","attributes":{"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Indistinguishable","description":"Upgrade difficulty of checks to identify character once per rank of Indistinguishable.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"qACNEdLAI7IfPkHc","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent4":{"name":"Uncanny Reactions","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Uncanny Reactions to all Vigilance checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"IJ5wgsvxJK1IZ7mG","attributes":{"Vigilance":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent5":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}},"links-top-1":true},"talent6":{"name":"Sleight of Mind","description":"Add [BO] to all Stealth checks unless the opposition is immune to Force powers.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 156 -

Life on the galactic frontier teems with vicious creatures and heartless criminals who would not think twice about gunning down innocent civilians. Bred from conflict and necessity, this is the galaxy where the Gunslinger lives and breathes. He is the best there is with a blaster, and he won't hesitate to show it.\n\n[P]The Gunslinger knows better than most that making a living in the Outer Rim Territories is a constant struggle. He needs to be fast on the draw to stay alive. The Gunslinger and his beloved sidearm are inseparable, but he often carries a holdout weapon when stuck in a hostile, target-rich environment. To face off with a Gunslinger is a dangerous and foolish proposition.\n\n[P]The bonus career skills for the Gunslinger are [B]Coercion, Cool, Knowledge (Outer Rim),[b] and [B]Ranged (Light)[b], all of which he uses to survive on the fringe. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending additional starting experience. The Gunslinger has lethal aim and an attitude to match, making him one of the deadliest beings in the Outer Rim.\n\n[P]A Gunslinger often has a special bond with his favorite weapon. His knack for gunplay often earns him a reputation that puts him at odds with other bandits who want to prove their mettle. This lifestyle is second nature to the Gunslinger, so he knows how to keep his cool when threatened. When some thug sticks a blaster in his face, the Gunslinger doesn't flinch. He shoots first and skips asking questions.\n[P]The Gunslinger often needs to remain one step ahead of the law, and so he wanders the Outer Rim in search of his next job. The hard life of the galactic frontier is not all gunfights, so the Gunslinger takes on work wherever he can find it. The Gunslinger uses his underworld contacts to secure odd jobs for a variety of criminal groups. Gunslingers also use their piloting knowledge to take on freight or smuggling jobs.\n\n[P]A Gunslinger character can fill countless roles within a campaign. He might find work onboard a bulk freighter defending crew and cargo from pirates. A Bodyguard might opt to pick up the Gunslinger specialization on the side to improve his ability to defend his spoiled Coruscanti debutante client. A Tapani nobleman taking up pistols in a duel to maintain the honor of his house might also find the Gunslinger specialization invaluable.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Fly Casual[h4]","attributes":{"tcbw07faxcf25wk4":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"03byg0z120emfdf4":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"lg15hqsj38azbloj":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"cakgyfgmy5weeku6":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"j9ybpr2mazbxmip1":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"qdu1kmwl34o9mas0":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Quick Strike","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Quick Strike to combat checks against targets that have not acted yet this encounter.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"9Fywc1fbC1WuNKC6","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Rapid Reaction","description":"Suffer a number of strain to add an equal number of [SU] to initiative checks.

{"name":"Makashi Duelist","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Makashi Duelist[h4]\n\nThe presence and showmanship that can come naturally to all Mystics reflects itself in the way of a duelist. For practitioners of Makashi, dominating a combat through one's presence is just as important as dominating it through martial prowess, and the Makashi Duelist is the ultimate expression of that art.\n\n[P]Makashi Duelists acquire [B]Charm, Cool, Coordination,[b] and [B]Lightsaber[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. This combination reflects the showmanship and presentation so intrinsic to the duelist's art. A true Makashi Duelist must always fight with poise and grace, never showing the slightest strain and keeping complete control over his facial expressions and his body's most minute movements.\n\n[P]Though some detractors may dismiss this fighting style as overly foppish and vain, a Makashi Duelist remains an exceptionally potent combatant. Those detractors forget that the Makashi form was developed to fight against other lightsaber-armed opponents. At its heart, Makashi focuses on one goal: to meet an enemy with a sword or lightsaber and slay him. A true Makashi Duelist never loses sight of this goal, and all his flourishes and feints are but means to an end. Movements that work to deflect and exhaust an opponent—particularly if the foe is not prepared for battle with a Force-sensitive—can soon leave an enemy frustrated with the entire experience. As the opponent becomes increasingly worn down, the Makashi Duelist soon finds an opportunity to exploit the foe's exhaustion.\n\n[P]A Makashi Duelist's force of personality, rather than natural athleticism, often drives his combat technique. Elements of personal flair become an effective means of disorienting and distracting an opponent during a battle. Sometimes a verbal misdirection can be every bit as effective as a physical one, leaving an opponent open to a single master stroke.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 82 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"iwbl44bzce8m6km1":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"v73vu03ey8a3d4cg":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"jk62bdyn5iysb5l0":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"m5v7n356gbbpfgdx":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"tqm0c6prixcz3nr9":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"mgjy87u4ad10itfl":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"29y5cnnk4ufn7sev":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"4mgcfe8dangeltbk":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Resist Disarm","description":"Suffer 2 strain to avoid being disarmed or have weapon damaged or destroyed.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"qqvZDGDghUQOqJh4","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Parry","description":"When hit by a melee attack, suffer 3 strain to reduce damage by 2 plus ranks in Parry.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 149 -

Some of these are animals that prey upon anything digestible. Others are malicious and twisted individuals who enjoy a savage and bloodthirsty existence. Hunters are Force adepts who are uniquely capable of tracking, confronting, and slaying these creatures, particularly those who hide in the wilds, far from civilization.\n\n[P]Hunters acquire [B]Coordination, Ranged (Heavy), Stealth,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills. If this is the PC's starting specialization, he chooses two of these skills and gains one free rank in each. These ranks do not cost experience. Hunters need to be able to sneak up on their targets, move through difficult terrain, and be constantly alert to their surroundings. Many hunters train with ranged weapons so that they can strike their targets from far away.\n\n[P]Most Hunters initially embark upon their careers focused on animal prey. Few, however, engage in this practice out of a desire to prove their mettle or a thirst for blood. Rather, their connection to the Force often lets them differentiate between predators that hunt out of necessity from those that are actively malicious. A Hunter does not normally interfere in the natural cycle of life, but he's more than willing to restore balance by eliminating a predator that kills needlessly and destroys natural habitats. Sadly, these foul and twisted animalistic intelligences also have their parallels within sentient beings.

{"name":"Force Sensitive Exile","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Force Sensitive Exile[h4]\n\nThe Jedi are gone, the vast majority hunted down and destroyed by the Emperor and his minions. If any survive, they do so in hiding at the farthest edges of the galaxy. The Galactic Empire regards the ability to use the Force as a crime punishable by the harshest measures. In a few short decades, most of the galaxy has forgotten the Jedi, and dismissed the Force as an ancient religion. For many, this is by far the safest option.\n\n[P]However, although the Empire has purged the Jedi, not all who use the Force have been hunted down and killed. The galaxy is simply too large to track down every Force-sensitive being, and the Emperor's infamous Order 66 and the hunts that followed primarily concerned themselves with pursuing true Jedi and their descendants and allies. In the hidden corners of the galaxy, those who can touch the Force remain hidden, hunted, and outcast... but alive.\n\n[P]The Force Sensitive Exile specialization does not have any career skills associated with it. However, when a character purchases this specialization, he automatically receives a Force rating of 1, if he did not already have it. If he already has a Force rating of 1 or higher, it does not increase.\n\n[P]Although technically someone is Force sensitive from birth, it can take a great deal of time for him to realize he has this power. For this reason, the Force Sensitive Exile specialization can be taken during character creation or at any later point, just as any other specialization.\n\n[P]The Force Sensitive Exile is not just any Force-sensitive being; he is one who survived the purges. He may have been a young Padawan or even a minor Jedi who managed to flee the Empire and hide. He may also have been a child, hidden by friends or family. Whatever the case, he's spent the last decades in a hostile galaxy. His formal training is likely to be limited or even non-existent, and he uses his powers carefully or not at all. Even his mastery of the Force is shaped by his experiences—his powers focus more around concealment and control than flashy displays of ability.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 276 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"azv6qfuayehtjwib":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Uncanny Senses","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Uncanny Senses to all Perception checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"DXUoFuMB2aVMhu4w","attributes":{"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Insight","description":"Perception and Discipline become career skills.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"o0iK0PujCJXtDOLf","attributes":{"k0iieyi2q6p1wk72":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"rb6fsid7ohavzh2t":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true}}},"talent2":{"name":"Forager","description":"Remove up to [SE][SE] from skill checks to find food, water, or shelter.

{"name":"Big-Game Hunter","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Big-Game Hunter - The Thrill of the Hunt[h4]\n\n[P]With the skills of a survivalist, the instincts of a bounty hunter, and the courage of a madman, the Big-Game Hunter tends to baffle everyone with his desire to actively track down, confront, and do battle with the most terrifying creatures in the galaxy. He understands and respects the environments he must contend with in order to pursue his quarry, yet he is less interested in where he is going than in what he is going to kill when he gets there.\n\n[P]Though some true pacifists may take great exception to the notion, Big-Game Hunters tend to believe they are performing a service to the people of the galaxy. They generally seek out truly dangerous and deadly creatures to fight and kill, thus making more areas in the galaxy safe for sentient habitation.\n\n[P]With a focus on all aspects of the hunt, the bonus career skills for a Big-Game Hunter are [B]Knowledge (Xenology), Ranged (Heavy), Stealth,[b] and [B]Survival[b]. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience. Big-Game Hunters tend to know how to get where their prey is, how to stay alive once they get there, and all about whatever it is they are there to do battle with.\n\n[P]Of course, there are plenty of hunters who are more than willing to kill pretty much anything that can net them a hefty profit, whether for pelts, horns, organs, or whatever else someone is willing to pay for. There are some hunters who take specific contracts from local governments to thin out a herd of something that is growing too large or to eliminate particularly enraged (and possibly infected) creatures that pose a danger to civilization.\n\n[P]For a Player Character, a Big-Game Hunter may not seem like a good fit at first. However, his general Explorer capabilities combined with his survival skills and his talent for fighting particularly dangerous foes may well make him a linchpin for a group's success. Many Big-Game Hunters will take whatever jobs they can find out in the Rim just for the chance to travel to new places and see what there is to hunt.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 27 - Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{"27q29hntz4zwet3w":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"m6p768ajnrj9h2ns":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"y8h4boh69xg0nb16":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"7gdrurrb6nd52j5t":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"nua6x5k8lfy33veb":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"fdd1wpef9oj3nb1n":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Forager","description":"Remove up to [SE][SE] from skill checks to find food, water, or shelter.

{"name":"Instructor","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Instructor - Head of the Class[h4]\n\nWhen it comes to showing the untested masses of the galaxy how to fight and win, an excellent\nInstructor is crucial. After all, handing untrained enlistees\na blaster and sending them into the thick of combat\nis a good way of getting them killed before they’ve\neven had a chance to make a difference. Instructors\nensure that no one is sent to fight the Empire before\nthey’re ready, preventing Rebel blood from being\nspilled in vain. Though their own role is primarily one of\nsupport, Instructors must also be proficient in the skills\nthey impart to their students, making them effective\nsoldiers when they are inevitably called to fight.\n[P]Instructors receive [B]Discipline. Medicine,\nRanged (Heavy),[b] and [B]Knowledge\n(Education)[b] as additional career\nskills. If this is the character’s starting\nspecialization, the player may\nchoose two of these skills and gain\none free rank in each without\nspending experience. Not all\nInstructors need to be combat-ready, but most of those\nemployed by the Rebel Alliance\nhave, by necessity, at\nleast some combat capability available to them. An Instructor must also have\nenough empathy to identify\nwith students and to discern which\nareas they excel in and where they\nrequire improvement.\n[P]It takes intense control to maintain\na professional demeanor and\nconcentrate on the job at hand,\nboth for Instructors and for their\nrecruits. Order must be maintained\nboth on and off the field\nso that would-be soldiers aren’t\ncowed by the sights, sounds,\nand demands of combat. Imparting\ndiscipline to their students,\nespecially if they’ve never held a\nweapon, is crucial if Instructors\nwant to see them survive the rigors\nof warfare.\n[P]Some Instructors are also well versed in the use of\nMedicine. Not only is first aid a skill that every soldier\nshould possess, but injuries occur all too often during\nintensive training. Passing on the basics of Medicine to\nrecruits ensures that trainees can save not only their\ncomrades, but themselves as well. If training recruits\nto use medpacs and synthflesh to patch up wounds is\nall an Instructor is assigned to do, then Medicine may\nvery well be that character’s primary focus.\n[P]Every soldier must learn how to shoot, so many\nInstructors are also accomplished marksmen.\nTrainees not only need to know\nhow to fire their weapon with the\nintention of hitting the enemy,\nbut they must also learn how to\ncare for and maintain it under\nbattlefield conditions. Drilling\nrecruits with a blaster comprises\nthe basics of infantry training. Initial training is with\nan unloaded weapon, to get\nrecruits comfortable with carrying\nit, used to its weight, and\nvaguely uncomfortable when it’s\nnot within reach. Many hours of port-arms and awareness\n drills are held before a recruit\nis allowed to fire a fully charged\nblaster downrange at a target.\n[P]Though it seems to go without\nsaying, Instructors must be well\neducated. Being skilled at conveying their knowledge to their\nstudents is an important part of\ntheir job description. When integrated with a Rebel cell or combat\nunit, Instructors can be a benefit\nto everyone they serve with.\nAs teachers, they must be able to\ndemonstrate the correct way to\ndo something under any circumstances.\nIt’s highly unlikely that\nthey wouldn’t be able to show\neveryone a trick or two when the\nchips are down.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Lead by Example[h4]","attributes":{"jllga0daw4gj04uk":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"q7qou3bf90bu6zkn":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"iwgmflzfruix2134":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"wtplq1c6q9dsbfjg":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"1j1y3vjkuibgcmwy":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"9cbjnnpciap564ov":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Conditioned","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Conditioned from Athletics and Coordination checks.

In fact, some believe they would find it too easy to abuse their unique abilities if they placed themselves in a position of leadership. Instead, they choose to accept the Advisor's role to ensure they cannot be corrupted by the lure of power. Others feel their advice too valuable to limit to one planet or region and wander the stars, sowing the guidance of the Force wherever they might go. Socially adept and Force-sensitive characters with either of these philosophies can be excellent fits for the Advisor specialization.\n\n[P]Advisors acquire [B]Charm, Deception, Negotiation,[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] as additional career skills. If this is the characters starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. This combination enables Advisors to take a very pragmatic approach in working with others and offering them the guidance of the Force. An accomplished Advisor can quickly analyze the risks of a situation and then, using the necessary tools, influence the involved parties so that a desired outcome is rapidly achieved. A less scrupulous individual with these techniques could become a successful con artist. Advisors must be careful to avoid that fate.\n\n[P]Some Advisors attach themselves to a planetary government, helping to shape the rule of law and ensure fairness and justice for all. Many popular rulers have had wise Advisors at hand, helping ensure their policies do the most good for the greatest number. Other Advisors choose to work in less glamorous roles—often among the poor and the desperate. There, they try to counsel and guide individuals in dire straits, sometimes providing salvation to those who have lost all hope.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 81 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"qwsk7di2dur5yxct":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"1g1rdeaygsyd4hh5":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ysnlyug9mya6au5a":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ixhb7no7o3bde97z":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"8v06a3qwmhicny74":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"tknbrp6aqz5ma6f3":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"79yoo9q1hpxo8eyk":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"n4i5xx0yeakhzqw4":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Plausible Deniability","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Plausible Deniability from all Coercion and Deception checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"JV0sdFJNxWKFJene","attributes":{"Coercion":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Know Somebody","description":"Once per session, when attempting to purchase a legally available item, reduce its rarity by 1 per rank of Know Somebody.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"0BHeQVF2GBLZac8t","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Kill With Kindness","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Kill with Kindness from all Charm and Leadership checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"QtzzTgVNnnjRrphd","attributes":{"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Leadership":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent4":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}},"links-top-1":true},"talent5":{"name":"Know Somebody","description":"Once per session, when attempting to purchase a legally available item, reduce its rarity by 1 per rank of Know Somebody.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"0BHeQVF2GBLZac8t","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true},"talent6":{"name":"Knowledge is Power","description":"Once per session, when making a check count Force rating as being equal to ranks in Knowledge (Lore).[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"OlTer0I8cCkDZAUr","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true},"talent7":{"name":"Nobody's Fool","description":"May upgrade difficulty of incoming Charm, Coercion, or Deception checks once per rank of Nobody's Fool.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"R94udJt3yVpNQXv3","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true},"talent8":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"links-top-1":true},"talent9":{"name":"Smooth Talker","description":"When first acquired choose 1 skill; Charm, Coercion, Deception, or Negotiation.

{"name":"Sentry","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Sentry - Hunting The Hunters[h4]\nDespite the grand legends of the Jedi and their sweeping battles in half-forgotten wars, neighborhoods still need day-to-day protection. Padawans may have dreamt of striking down an evil general or forging alliances between powerful armies, but  when they became Sentries, they patrolled the streets streets, city blocks, and alleyways to help the overlooked, the common people. These foot soldiers gained none of the glory of their peers, and their thankless tasks have not been preserved in Jedi myths, but their work has benefited countless lives throughout the years.\n[P]Sentries gain access to the additional career skills of [B]Coordination[b], [B]Lightsaber[b], [B]Stealth[b] and [B]Vigilance[b]. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Although both have a lightsaber-focused specialization, Sentries and Shien Experts differ considerably. Whereas Shien Experts approach life and combat as tactical exercises, Sentries concentrate on the immediate and the personal. They reach their targets through speed or subterfuge, stay aware of potential threats, and strike sure and quick.\n[P]Sentries are concerned with the present; a crime committed is a violation too far and stopped too late. While other Sentinels concern themselves on the bigger picture, Sentries pick up the pieces in the moment. They catch those who slip through the cracks and are forgotten, and stop those who break through safeguards to do irreparable damage. To Sentries, the details are the real picture, and allowing one person to suffer in order to promote justice is no justice at all.\n[P]Perhaps the most personally engaged of the Sentinel specialists, Sentries defend individuals, whether a specific person they are charged with protecting or a random person walking down the street. During the days of the Jedi Order, Sentries were accused of being too attached to the singular, becoming too emotionally involved with people and losing sight of larger tasks. However, the sentries remained steadfast, channeling grief, anger, and love into pushing themselves to their limits to save their charges, and finding strength in their personal attachments.\n[P]Despite their efforts—or perhaps because of them—Sentries don't have a glowing reputation for purity. They revel in their reputation, utilizing fear and surprise against their opponents. Sentries can only maintain this reputation among their adversaries if their communities fear them as well. They must become the monster who the monsters fear.\n[P]The Force guides Sentries to be in the right place at the right time to prevent violence. They move unseen, sometimes on rooftops to get a higher perspective, sometimes in the shadows to get an up-close point of view. Their senses expand as Sentries search for an opportunity, an opening, to get the jump on evil.\n[P]Once engaged in combat, their priorities change. After slipping out of the shadows or dropping down from above, sentries operate visibly and encourage their enemies to target them. Sentries want to be the most intimidating and to be the most dangerous-looking so that their enemies will fear them and fight them rather than their charges. Their talents lie not in ending a fight quickly or attacking directly though.

{"name":"Ascetic","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Ascetic[h4]\n\nThere are many paths that might lead one to the role of Ascetic. Whether they are particularly sensitive and seek seclusion to contend with some failure that haunts their steps or wish to contemplate the greater role of the Force in the galaxy at large. Ascetics are individuals driven to a calmer, more contemplative approach to their life, their needs, and their place in the galaxy. They do not seek to gather credits, possessions, or laurels, but rather judge their worth by the depth of their understanding of and communion with the Force.\n[P]Ascetic receive [B]Athletics, Discipline, Resilience,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience. While most Consulars focus on the acquisition of helpful skills and abilities, Ascetics concentrate on honing their own mind to a razor focus. As a result, they are likely to have a higher strain threshold than any other Consular specialization, and they have the versatility to work their way through almost any difficulty. An Ascetic has spent a considerable time living on the fringes of society, learning to make do with whatever materials and facilities were on hand regardless of their apparent functionality or crude construction. Ascetics may be out of practice in social interactions and interpersonal communication, but the awareness and resilience they have gained through their trials, as well, as the physical strength their chosen path has earned them, can be invaluable to a group when more refined, civilized plans have failed.\n[P]An Ascetic may be found almost anywhere, from the urban wastelands and undercities of the Core Worlds to the most inhospitable and isolated corners of the Outer Rim. The distractions and demands of the outside world can jar even the most focused, powerful minds from the spiritual path. Those who retreat from the noise and the chaos follow the path of the Ascetic. There are times when even the greatest must set themselves apart, focusing on the spheres of the spirit and the mind to the exclusion of all else. By embracing isolation and hardship, many Consulars are able to realize levels of potential that more mundane training techniques could never unleash.\n[P]Many Ascetics have chosen their lonely path of deprivation and meditation to plumb the depths of a specific mystery, a troubling event in the balance of the galaxy, or a great personal failing. The growth made possible through this introspection and self-denial means that when Ascetics choose to emerge from their self-imposed exile, they are ideally suited to confront any situation, with the adaptability of hard-won experience. Often Consulars will surface from such isolation to take up a particular cause or purpose, driven from quiet contemplation of the galaxy by a troubling imbalance sensed from the depths of their serenity.\n[P]The Ascetic can well prove to be one of the most versatile characters in his group. Between his high strain threshold, demanding physical training, and versatility bread through voluntary deprivation, an Ascetic can often provide flexible, insightful leadership to his group. Although perhaps lacking in some of the more subtle social skills of other Consulars, an Ascetic knows that meditation on the Force can only take one so far. The knowledge earned through such rigorous contemplation must eventually be put to use in the galaxy at large, either through teaching or direct action, to better bring balance to the Force.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 24 - Disciples of Harmony[h4]","attributes":{"kl3v98sxtfdbg9pv":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"nckh5u79wz8361jv":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"zp49jyrdxiow3kbn":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"wpag7gasuv8wp1yv":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"k0x7wkae65pcbfu0":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"f8dm4dxh377r2ltl":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"27q8gwfkb7uul1mg":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"k1xv5epwu1brlnsd":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Physical Training","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Physical Training to Athletics and Resilience checks.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 154 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 30 - Disciples of Harmony[h4][H4]Page 41 - Rise of the Separatists[h4][H4]Page 42 - Collapse of the Republic[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"PQ8V4gEwKc1qrIp8","attributes":{"Athletics":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Resilience":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Confidence","description":"May decrease difficulty of Discipline checks to avoid fear by 1 per rank of Confidence.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 133 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 144 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 141 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"2leaEwirkfKu5Ego","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent4":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"links-top-1":true},"talent5":{"name":"Force Protection","description":"Perform the Force Protection maneuver; suffer 1 strain and commit [FO] up to ranks of Force Protection.

{"name":"Ataru Striker","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Ataru Striker[h4]\n\nWhen working alone in a hostile environment, every physical conflict must be resolved quickly and decisively. Frequently, an uncivilized planet completely lacks any sort of medical facilities. In fact, at times, an isolated explorer could be the only sentient being on the world. In such a situation, a minor injury can be deadly. If a conflict is necessary, it is better to resolve it quickly, taking whatever risks are involved, than to fight more conservatively and prolong the risk of injury. The Ataru Striker embraces this approach, throwing himself into combat with every fiber of his being.\n\n[P]Ataru Strikers acquire [B]Athletics, Coordination, Lightsaber,[b] and [B]Perception[b] as additional career skills. If this is the characters starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in 'each, without spending starting experience. This fighting style is highly dependent on the combatant's ability to quickly assess a situation and use natural athleticism to exploit the environment. In this way, the combatant is able to gain every possible advantage over an opponent. The combination of these edges and the rapid attacks that characterize Ataru martial arts can force a combat to a very quick resolution.\n[P]Practitioners of the Ataru fighting style must be supremely confident in their abilities. They must also be exceptionally athletic and capable of committing all their energy into a very brief conflict. When engaged in a physical conflict, Ataru Strikers fight without remorse but also with little concern for their own safety. Every motion is designed to inflict a flurry of rapid and overpowering attacks against their opponents from myriad angles. Their vicious and unrelenting offense is their best (and sometimes only) defense—most opponents are so busy defending themselves that they have no time to attack in turn.\n\n[P]However, this style of unrelenting attack can have its disadvantages. An Ataru Striker needs to see his opponent defeated quickly, before he exhausts himself.

{"name":"Warleader","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Warleader - The Shrewd Leader[h4]\nNot all Guardians solve their problems through feats of prowess with the lightsaber alone. The mind can be a deadlier weapon still, and a little foresight can do as much to win a battle as the greatest feat of heroism. The Warleader possesses a number of tricks and abilities that help to carry the day in battle, and more importantly, to keep friends and allies alive to fight another day.\n[P]Warleaders are calculating fighters who rely more on mental acuity and guile tan on raw combat strength. While Warleaders are capable combatants in their own right, thanks to their ranged combat skills, their greatest edge comes when they have comrades in arms to guide in battle. Unlike Peacekeepers, Warleaders do not focus on inspiring others; while individual Warleaders might indeed be charismatic, their friends trust them with their lives not because of rousing speeches, but because of their reliability in the field.\n[P]Warleaders might not protect their allies by deftly deflecting blaster shots with  lightsaber or heroically taking blows meant for them, but their guidance can keep comrades safe just the same. Warleaders acquire [B]Leadership, Perception, Ranged (Light) and Survival[b] as additional career skills, all of which assist them in negotiation on the battlefield and guiding their allies across it. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may chose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Whether through formal military training, practical combat experience or simply having keen minds, PC's who take on this specialization are well-equipped to handle matters of strategy and tactics. Warleaders often have an intuitive grasp of the field of combat thanks to their connection to the Force, and combine this with shrewd tactics to concoct and execute forward-thinking plans that seem almost prescient to their foes. Cover is an especially valuable resource for Warleaders. They can use it not only to grant their comrades additional defensive benefits, but also to gain the edge over enemies by guiding allies to strike them from unexpected angles.\n[P]Trust is the foundation of any Warleader's command. More often than not in [B]Force and Destiny[b], a party of Player Characters consists of a group of equals pursuing a common goal rather than a formally structured organization. Even if one PC is nominally in charge, that person might or might not be the Warleader. When battle breaks out, however, the Warleader keeps friends out of the line of fire, exposes weaknesses in enemy plans, and comes up with cunning strategies  that catch foes off guard.\n[P]Outside of battle, the Warleader's acute problem-solving skills can also be very useful, as can the character's foresight. Regardless of the situation, the Warleader can look at challenges from an angle others might have neglected. In doing so, the Warleader can help lead the group to victory through unexpected solutions.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Keeping the Peace[h4]","attributes":{"v0wwopakoh9mrebc":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"lss9x8iav6p24f5y":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"84dc6gnxvpmvm46a":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"0otnuxntxwyxy5ih":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"uu60lkreajdlnhwc":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"se0em0tqysatkz34":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"1gr910vy0zcmt8k0":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"miqh2xpstxo68d1z":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Prime Positions","description":"When this character or an ally in short range takes cover, he increases soak against ranged attacks by 1 per rank of Prim Positions until he leaves that cover.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Keeping the Peace[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"UEtMgSQOUIVRyvjD","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Suppressing Fire","description":"The character and each ally within short range may spend [AD] on their failed combat checks to inflict one strain on the target per rank of Suppressing Fire.

{"name":"Commando","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Commando - Strike the Target[h4]\n\nCommandos are specialists trained to strike the enemy from unexpected directions to do the most damage in the most vulnerable locations. Commando teams are often used like surgical instruments by the commanders who have access to them. A Commando knows how to find a target, attack it, disable it, survive the aftermath, and find his way home.\n\n[P]Commandos gain [B]Brawl, Melee, Resilience,[b] and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills. If Commando is the character's first specialization, two of these new career skills gain a free rank each. Commandos are masters of close combat and surviving in all conditions. They are usually good at sneaking past enemy guards and listening posts as well.\n\n[P]For any team, a Commando is a fine general-purpose combat specialist to have around. He handles fights well (especially hand-to-hand situations), and can manage in almost any high-stress situation. More often than not, he's also effective as backup during covert operations. Matters of overall philosophy or strategy rarely concern a Commando; he's almost always focused on the mission at hand or training to ensure he and his companions survive the next one.\n\n[P]As stand-up confrontations are normally a losing proposition for the Alliance, the Commandos are some of the most important and effective soldiers fighting for the Rebellion. Their capacity to surgically strike at Imperial targets, as well as their value as guards and support personnel for other specialists operating on behalf of the Alliance, makes any single one of them worth more than a platoon of stormtroopers.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 91 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"6uxa9dj4r0y5ph5n":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"18ci1berwsi1yrbg":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"flwku4ajqhnc8px1":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"h6o5ky3x21o21xq3":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"j8vnecaptm8nu1dn":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"xv3rd2pw38f87th3":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"rnqg3rk7gek477bz":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"swlvav63czcfpqha":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Physical Training","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Physical Training to Athletics and Resilience checks.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 154 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 30 - Disciples of Harmony[h4][H4]Page 41 - Rise of the Separatists[h4][H4]Page 42 - Collapse of the Republic[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"PQ8V4gEwKc1qrIp8","attributes":{"Athletics":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Resilience":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent3":{"name":"Point Blank","description":"Add 1 damage per rank of Point Blank to damage of one hit of successful attack while using Ranged (Heavy) or Ranged (Light) skills at short range or engaged.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"YgEF85qgK6KUhjTM","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent5":{"name":"Durable","description":"May reduce any Critical Injury suffered by 10 per rank of Durable to a minimum of 1.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"EhNw9MNLk2TKEQxk","attributes":{},"links-right":true},"talent6":{"name":"Physical Training","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Physical Training to Athletics and Resilience checks.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 154 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 30 - Disciples of Harmony[h4][H4]Page 41 - Rise of the Separatists[h4][H4]Page 42 - Collapse of the Republic[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"PQ8V4gEwKc1qrIp8","attributes":{"Athletics":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Resilience":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent7":{"name":"Strong Arm","description":"Treat thrown weapons as if they had 1 greater range.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"ipV3SZuu6uwNhRjE","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true},"talent8":{"name":"Blooded","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Blooded to all checks to resist or recover from poisons, venoms, or toxins.

{"name":"Performer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Performer - The Burden of Art[h4]\n\n[P]The Performer must always be the center of attention, and if all eyes aren't on the Performer, he has ways to make them shift their focus. For them, all the world is a stage, and the Performer is always putting on a show. They can lie with more sincerity than even the Politico, and do so as easily as if they were running lines for a one-man showing of the Kallea Cycle. They can be as charming as a diplomat, and leave their targets enchanted and completely manipulatable. And far too many people underestimate the strength many Performers must possess for acrobatics, athletics, and even live theater.\n\n[P]Performers receive [B]Charm, Coordination, Deception,[b] and [B]Melee[b] as additional career skills. If this'Is the character's starting specialization, he gains one free rank in each of two of these skills of his choice, without spending experience. The Performer often leans on pouts, winks, warm smiles, and well timed physical contact mixed with outright lies to get whatever he wants from whomever he wants. He draws on the best lines from the greatest works of literature, theater, and holo from millennia past, and always has a unique, flattering compliment for any being from whom he might want something.\n\n[P]Other Performers may rely on different tactics in their interactions. A cutting comedian or brilliant actor can hurl a litany of insults that cut to the core of most beings, making them question their worth and their right to deny the Performer what he wants. Unfortunately, these almost psychotic breaks are just as likely to be directed against their closest allies and assistants as enemies. The Performer knows how to use this to his advantage, though, and can create a scene to distract a bouncer while his friends sneak into a club that would otherwise never have granted them access.\n\n[P]However, there is often more to a Performer than just words. Performers may include dancers, acrobats, jugglers, and other individuals who must possess impressive coordination and be at peak physical condition. Their acrobatic abilities can give some Performers an unexpected edge in a fight. In addition, many have been trained in martial arts and the use of stage weaponry for roles in theater or holovids. The agility and overall fitness required to perform on stage means they are often in great shape, and as such, it is not uncommon for the Performer to be the last one standing when the dust settles.\n\n[P]Whether the character is a galaxy-famous magician or merely the member of a traveling troupe of acrobats, the players can build their entire party around a Performer. Performers need an agent, bodyguards, assistants, technicians for their performance, a pilot, perhaps a personal physician, and certain friends or family for their entourage. Performers are able to take the lead in social situations and provide support during combat, but can also take a back seat to a diplomatic leader able to wrangle him. The only downside to including a Performer in the party is that whatever his specialty, he makes his living through some sort of acting. Once can never be sure what a Performer thinks about everyone else.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Far Horizons[h4]","attributes":{"a0twau6884hpgfk1":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"03qe1oc1qyw878up":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"fqq8h4wr3vs64820":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kxvsj9sw2ensrhow":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"qgwpgzjugdu1p49z":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"18xhjv9194elht4j":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"5szs1c4fdp70y5g2":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"wxscgbw9rvbf5eaj":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Smooth Talker","description":"When first acquired choose 1 skill; Charm, Coercion, Deception, or Negotiation.

{"name":"Sapper","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Sapper - To Construct and Destroy[h4]\nSappers have a versatile role in the Alliance. These personnel are responsible not only for building encampments, installations, landing areas, and more to support the war against the Empire, but also for seeking out and destroying many of the same that the enemy possesses. This means these combat Engineers must combine stealth, survival skills, and situational awareness to find suitable locations and analyze defensive possibilities, as well as using the same skills to probe for enemy structural weaknesses that can be exploited with suitable explosives.\n[P]Sappers receive [B]Athletics, Knowledge (Warfare), Mechanics,[b] and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Once Sappers find a good location for construction, they must deal with the logistical demands of supplies. Construction efforts mean they have three bosses that will never agree: the environment, the laws of physics, and their commander. Sappers prioritize each differently, and that decision can make or break a construction project. As with most support jobs, when Sappers do an excellent job, no one notices. Alliance soldiers don' t give a second thought to a warm bunk and good lighting in a base, for example, or pilots to a spacious and smooth-floored hangar. If these aren't present, however, Sappers get the blame (and also the overnight repair duties).\n[P]Sappers do see battle, perhaps more so than any other support personnel save medics. Command sends Sappers to sneak up to enemy fortifications to find weaknesses and entry points. This work often requires a hands-on inspection of the enemy base, looking for cracks in walls, exposed power lines or sewage pipes, or unattended guard rotations and resupply schedules. A scouting mission requires stealth or a cover identity, and Sappers must avoid capture or death from guards or automated security systems while successfully mapping the enemy's weak points.\n[P]Sappers who survive initial scouting missions must then infiltrate enemy sites to set explosive charges, carefully cut away security grids, or perform another act of sabotage, all while avoiding being killed by blaster fire or a mistimed explosive charge. Even if capture or death is unavoidable, Sappers must press on, as the lives of many of their comrades depend on their sacrifice.\n[P]After all that, Sappers who survive may still have to pick up a blaster and join the rest of the soldiers in storming the fortification. Perhaps the operation went off without a hitch, and the Alliance has provided evac to carry Sapper teams back to safety. Many refuse to retreat.

{"name":"Teacher","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Teacher[h4]\n\nThere comes a time in the life of most who feel the draw of the Force when they decide that they can best serve the galaxy by passing along the accumulated knowledge and wisdom of their lifetime. Whether they have been classically trained in one of the ancient disciplines, have pursued a more mundane education in an academy or conservatory, or are self-taught through innate discipline and drive, Teachers now seek to assist others in gaining the training and enlightenment they have accrued. Through the efforts of Teachers, their allies can attain greater abilities and assets than they would have alone.\n[P]A Teacher's additional career skill are [B]Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Lore), Leadership,[b] and [B]Perception[b]. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Given their selection of skills, Teachers will be far better at enhancing the potential of their group than any other Consular. In addition to providing valuable assistance to their companions, Teachers are more than capable of holding their own in almost any situation. They can pursue a wide range of skills and abilities with an eye toward passing this knowledge along to others. Teachers feel the presence of the Force throughout their life and will feel the draw of many paths through the years. Through this process, they will accumulate a vast store of knowledge and experience. Many reach a point where the drive to push on is overcome by the desire to push on is overcome by the desire to pass on their knowledge to others, to better serve the galaxy.\n[P]Some Teachers work closely with established schools and academies, perhaps echoing the techniques and traditions of the fallen Jedi Temple. Many of these work in the Outer Rim, far from the prying eyes of the Galactic Empire. Others, feeling no need for more advanced aids and accoutrements, content themselves with little more than a clearing or a log to sit their pupils upon, from which they might contemplate the mysteries of the galaxy together. Teachers are often keenly aware of their place in the scheme of life and seek to pass the peace and assurance of this knowledge on to their students, that their own purposes. No matter the particular goal of the moment, a Teacher will have advice and instruction to assist in its achievement.\n[P]In the course of a lifetime, any setting can turn into a classroom with a willing Teacher on one side and an apt pupil on the other. Whether in a dry, dusty hut in the middle of a desert, the sodden expanse of a humid swamp, or the cramped confines of a tramp freighter, Teachers will do what is needed to see that their students are prepared for the tasks that lie before them.\n[P]Often the path of the Teacher is not one that is selected, but one that is thrust upon one by circumstance. In the pursuit of expansive goals, it may be hard to realize that it is best left to others to achieve them, the responsibility of the Teacher being to assist them and shepherd them along. Having a Teacher in a group can be a great boon no matter the goal, given the versatility of Teachers' abilities and their capacity to assist other members of their group in any efforts they may make. When the need is greatest and a new generation must rise to confront the darkness, there can be no greater ally in the Force than knowledge passed down from the vantage of experience and understanding.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 25 - Disciples of Harmony[h4]","attributes":{"sqbtd30lq7t2tnvl":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"w97mra10ceau3sie":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"8hz3gp90j1t1t2d3":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"pdyfnqmqt5x9yh5l":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Researcher","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Researcher from all Knowledge checks.

{"name":"Republic Navy Officer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Republic Navy Officer[h4]\nWaging war against the Confederacy or Independent Systems requires the coordination the brightest military minds within the Republic. The clone army is an effective fighting force on the ground, but it is only as effective as the tactical leadership that commands and supports it from orbit. Drawn from the experienced commanders of Republic worlds' various system defense fleets, the naval Officers of the Republic serve as the Grand Army's frontline strategic leadership amid the raging conflict. Even the Jedi rely on the judgment of the officers they fight beside, as they lack the experience necessary to conduct large-scale naval actions or organize troop deployments.\n\n[H4]MILITARY BRILLIANCE[h4]\n\n[P]Victory is a moving target, which makes the task of a Republic Navy Officer immensely difficult. While the Separatists have been building and training their commanders in secret for years, the Republic leadership was largely unprepared for the sudden onset of open conflict.\n\n[P]The Jedi and the Senate are not experienced at waging war, so they have been forced to draw their officers from the isolated defense fleets scattered throughout the Republic, resulting in a  diverse group of military commanders with wildly different skills, training, approaches, and experiences.\n\n[P]Yet, one thing the officers of the Republic Navy share is an excellent tactical and strategic sense. They are as capable of outmaneuvering a single dangerous warship as they are organizing the defense fleet of an entire star system. Having had to outwit pirates often before the war, officers know the spacelanes of the galaxy and can operate amid dangerous obstacles that would slag less experienced navigators.\n\n[P]To represent their training in tactical combat and command, a Republic Navy Officer receives [B]Astrogation, Discipline, Knowledge (Warfare),[b] and [B]Leadership[b] as additional career skills. Regardless of their unique background, a Republic Navy Officer understands war and knows what must be done to achieve victory.\n\n[P]Beyond their military expertise, a naval officer must be a capable leader. Even a brilliant strategy is useless if the spacers carrying it out don't have faith in their ship or fleet, and a talented officer inspires that faith. Whether captaining a single vessel or coordinating the assault of an entire armada, a Republic Navy Officer is a symbol to the crews they command. Clone troopers rely on the ships of the Navy to travel between worlds and reach the battlefield, and the best officers ensure not only victory in orbital battles, but pave the way for a successful ground strike.\n\n[P]In addition to inspiring the clones and other crew who serve under them, many Republic Navy Officers work closely with a Jedi general. Although a non-Jedi officer is officially outranked by their Jedi colleague, the officer's military experience often ensures they serve more as a mentor than a subordinate, and naval strategies are frequently developed by the two working in concert. The Jedi tend to be more at home directing ground engagements or leading starfighter dogfights, leaving the command of the orbital or interplanetary forces to their trusted naval commanders.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","attributes":{"3nrrnp5a263vio82":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"sv2ivq8i6sg4yz2f":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4i7gnwxj3z7vb91i":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"h22awflhh4fitk02":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"u1r3s42pzvmhuodk":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"oho8yz6ii44lu2e6":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Command","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Command when making Leadership checks.

{"name":"Saboteur","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Saboteur - Making Thing Stop[h4]\n\nAlmost anathema to the usual technician's mentality, the Saboteur specializes in disrupting and destroying technical and mechanical assets. His job is to diminish the enemy's capacity to wage war by denying the enemy use of its weapons and vehicles. Of course, it takes a high degree of understanding about how something works in order to ensure it ceases working, or better still, to ensure it never works again.\n\n[P]For a Saboteur, [B]Coordination, Mechanics, Skulduggery,[b] and [B]Stealth[b] are all additional career skills, and if this is the first chosen specialization, the PC gains a free rank in two of these. Saboteurs are, by nature, covert operation specialists with a strong need to be able to sneak in and out of enemy facilities. In addition, they understand that disrupting the computer networks that run such facilities is a key to success.\n\n[P]Blowing things up is a popular way to commit sabotage, and Saboteurs are often the best at handling demolitions tasks (often using a combination of Mechanics and Skulduggery). However, there are many other ways to disrupt and destroy machinery, and the Saboteur knows them all. Most often, he will seek a way to cause the most damage and the most chaos at just the right moment. For the Saboteur (especially one with a sense of style), timing is everything.\n[P]The Alliance makes quiet yet effective use of its Saboteurs. Though terrorism is not a part of the battle plan (and is expressly forbidden by Mon Mothma and the rest of the Alliance Council), acts of military sabotage are known to be highly effective in evening the odds before a battle. Most commanders in the Rebellion will simply indicate a target and a time frame, allowing the Saboteur to use his creativity and resourcefulness to achieve the objective.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 86 -

His ideal circumstance is to get into places blocked to others, grab things he's not supposed to have, and get out without anyone ever knowing he was there. If he can sell what he grabbed for a tidy sum, that makes for a perfect day.\n\n[P]Thieves gain the additional career skills [B]Computers, Skulduggery, Stealth,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b]. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Combined with his talents, a Thief is particularly adept at hiding, spotting the hidden, getting past locks and security, and getting the jump on opponents in combat. He also knows his way around the underworld and where to get what's needed.\n\n[P]Generally, Thieves tend to either operate with a group that shares in their larcenous goals, or they work alone. The galaxy is full of treasures, many of which are guarded by locks and goons. A Thief will gladly handle the locks, though he'll probably appreciate having some backup to handle the goons if things go badly. Then again, if he's truly good at what he does, that shouldn't happen. Some Thieves gain a strong enough reputation that they are offered contract opportunities by powerful people or groups. seeking to accomplish something against an opponent that is far beyond the realms of legal action. Of course, Thieves must always be on the lookout for a double-cross.\n\n[P]As a part of a Player Character team, a Thief may not even identify himself by his specialization, preferring to display skills and abilities that are more generically appropriate to his career as a Smuggler. Frankly, most Smugglers have at least some skill in the areas that he is masterful with, so he might never have to reveal much more than that. Still, having a master Thief on a team may mean getting into—and out of—some seriously difficult places in the future.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 85 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"cp6yw7keicd57orn":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"s78ejerqnobec2s2":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"mbhuxluegsqo94tr":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"sxaha8gf12brwi6g":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"xxeacgozkxq93xug":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"2ro30kdeov3om8pn":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"6m6b29g7t9509oq9":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"srujpf6d68e7xpfy":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{},"talent1":{"name":"Black Market Contacts","description":"When purchasing illegal goods, may reduce rarity by 1 per rank of Black Market Contacts, increasing cost by 50 percent of base cost per reduction.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 132 -

{"name":"Healer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Healer[h4]\n\nConsulars are often drawn to their career by a strong sense of compassion. In many, this is expressed by a desire to mitigate bodily harm and cure the sick. A Healer trains to do so, recognizing that helping the individual can be just as important as helping the entirety of galactic civilization.\n\n[P]Healers gain access to the additional career skills of [B]Discipline, Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Xenology),[b] and [B]Medicine[b]. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n\n[P]For some physicians, healing is focused entirely on the problems of the body. They treat injuries with a detached, clinical approach. A Healer, however, is driven by compassion and affinity with the Force. Because of this, a Healer takes a holistic approach toward medicine. Many Healers learn techniques that use the Force to fuel the body's natural recuperative abilities—sometimes transforming a potentially lethal injury into one that is survivable. They also seek to calm and heal the wounded spirit just as thoroughly as healing the wounded physical form.\n\n[P]Many Healers have very strong philosophical compunctions against physical violence. As they spend so much of their lives attempting to heal injuries, they can be extremely reluctant to inflict them. Consequently, those who study this specialization exclusively are less likely to gain abilities that are devoted to combat. Some Healers, however, can take the time to develop defensive techniques, believing that dangerous situations are often the ones in which they are most needed.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 69 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"3733luin225pjm20":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"x41tidvo34j1elet":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"3tstmec2k3vlhmgj":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"zjbjx3b955sp3bhz":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Surgeon","description":"When making a Medicine check to help a character heal wounds, the target heals 1 additional wound per rank of Surgeon.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"GkwtVE2cm9ny6MiB","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Healing Trance","description":"Commit [FO].

{"name":"Rigger","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Rigger - Vehicular Innovator[h4]\n\nWhile most Rebel Aces operate standard vehicles maintained by engineering crews, a surprising number bring their own private vehicles with them into a fight. The Rigger doesn't believe in risking his life from the seat of a stock-class anything, and is always adding, tweaking, and fine-tuning his vehicle not only to achieve the highest performance, but also to bring unexpected surprises with him to the battlefield.\n\n[P]Considering how outnumbered the Rebels find themselves in almost every engagement, it is no wonder that some of the Rebel Aces have taken it upon themselves to increase their survivability by learning about their vehicle. Riggers tend to have the highest rate of survivability in combat, and their offensive output at the start of a combat engagement can sometimes end a fight before it begins.\n[P]Riggers receive [B]Gunnery, Knowledge (Underworld), Mechanics,[b] and [B]Resilience[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he gains one free rank in each of two of these skills of his choice, without spending experience. The Rigger is fascinated with the golden age of innovation in starship engineering that exists during the Galactic Civil War. He keeps up to date with the latest technical journals and even trolls shadowfeeds, following his favorite engineers. He has a number of friends in the underworld's outlaw tech community, who provide parts and kits to test on his vehicle of choice. If his ship is somehow blasted and left adrift, leave it to the Rigger to find some way to get it moving again.\n[P]The Rigger is resilient in the face of a challenge, and usually turns to technology to find a solution to most problems he might encounter. The Rigger believes in his customized ship's ability to outperform any other vessel on the battlefield. He has painstakingly fine-tuned it to fly faster and further, hit harder, and take more punishment than the competition. Despite his impressive ability to mitigate damage done to his ship, a Rigger is a cautious pilot, and bemoans every dent and scratch his ship accrues during a battle. If a Rigger finds he is still somehow outgunned, he can jury-rig a special trick for the enemy on the fly to regain the technological advantage.\n[P]Most every team can benefit from a Rigger within their unit. Riggers bring a technological expertise that can apply to a variety of circumstances, and in combat, their vehicles are extremely durable offensive juggernauts. Riggers are also the only Ace to possess underworld contacts, which can prove useful for supplies, information, and even allies during missions. The biggest asset a Rigger brings to a team, though, is the element of surprise. Imperials don't expect an X-wing to have replaced its astromech slot with a bomb-bay—until the ordnance is already detonating across their carrier's bridge.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{"f8kizlrt5eutqqyr":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"wfsb98fqfg9kzxqw":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"fd5adhegzgnlqxy4":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"num14q7wxv4zp6on":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"0vzauuidrlgij450":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"j03yl6bsxdc9zcq4":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Black Market Contacts","description":"When purchasing illegal goods, may reduce rarity by 1 per rank of Black Market Contacts, increasing cost by 50 percent of base cost per reduction.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 132 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidental","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"9fZBEB8nm0CujVmw","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent2":{"name":"Gearhead","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Gearhead from Mechanics checks.

{"name":"Quartermaster","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Quartermaster - Managing the Resources[h4]\n\nAn old military saying goes something like this—\"Empty stomachs make for poor soldiers.\" The Quartermaster's job is to ensure this doesn't happen to the troops he supports. He also must ensure that weapons, ammunition, medical supplies, and everything else needed gets where it should be and into the right hands. Managing the flow of logistics is one of the most difficult tasks in any military organization, and the Quartermaster is the master of it.\n[P]Quartermasters gain [B]Computers, Negotiation, Skulduggery,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills. If this is a PC's first specialization, two of these four skills begin with a free rank each. Searching and manipulating data to their unit's benefit is a trick many Quartermasters employ, as is finding (and stealing) necessary resources when the cupboards are otherwise bare. Anyone involved in supply is inherently enamored of preparedness at all times.\n\n[P]The greatest commanders in any military place extraordinary emphasis on supply, relying heavily on their Quartermasters to see to it that logistical needs are met at all times. An otherwise-successful campaign will come to a screeching halt, perhaps even degrading into a terrible rout, if supply lines are not maintained and the warriors engaged with the enemy lose access to food, ammunition, and other vital needs. The Quartermaster understands the unique and challenging puzzle of finding, securing, and moving assets, and he seeks to fulfill his unit's needs no matter what is required.\n\nOne of the greatest challenges for the Alliance is that of supply; the best Quartermasters in service to the Rebellion are indispensable assets. As long as other Alliance units are not endangered by their actions, Quartermasters are given great leeway in their methods for acquiring needed resources and getting them to the front lines. Many of the best Quartermasters indulge in more than a little larceny, often targeting criminal organizations and even the Empire itself to get what they need.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 81 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"jn6qulid4udqqh3e":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ee6rik5rywya9lso":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"5tvzy4o610vtg4rq":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"74owiqm7iwv60f4w":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"apf8ulvus2tj62b2":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"xd65tgbd76tgldua":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"nj4qzxv41kbont5w":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"g0riyv5hflqfd75r":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Know Somebody","description":"Once per session, when attempting to purchase a legally available item, reduce its rarity by 1 per rank of Know Somebody.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"0BHeQVF2GBLZac8t","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Smooth Talker","description":"When first acquired choose 1 skill; Charm, Coercion, Deception, or Negotiation.

It focuses on the essentials of saber fighting and borrows heavily from other sword fighting techniques. Appropriately, the modern practitioners of this form focus on perfecting the core tenants of sword fighting, recognizing the strength of simplicity. Shii-Cho Knights eschew fancy maneuvers, preferring to focus on the fundamentals of block, parry. and strike.\n\n[P]Shii-Cho Knights acquire [B]Athletics, Coordination, Lightsaber,[b] and [B]Melee[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These skills provide them with a solid grounding in the core techniques of any physical conflict. They are familiar with the weapon they wield, but they are also very comfortable exploiting their natural athleticism and flexibility. Because of this, they can not only avoid an enemy's attack, but also make certain that they are able to strike effectively when their target is at a disadvantage.\n\n[P]Followers of this path are seldom concerned with personal appearances or the style that they exhibit in a conflict. Instead, they are focused on precision and on achieving their ultimate goal of victory. For them, a solid grounding in the basics is something they can rely on in any situation. When lives are on the line, they devote their attention to executing their maneuvers in a traditional way, using them to counter an opponent while simultaneously restricting his options.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 100 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"epnonjkyo3que080":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"1vix9370149lhtcy":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"p74iln7942n4w74y":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ketcatlpkb955z5y":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"btpa8jou99l1168f":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"uvn6mmjhp7rc4tcy":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4smql57opijqrhnf":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"q5ry91nn95gepg53":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Parry","description":"When hit by a melee attack, suffer 3 strain to reduce damage by 2 plus ranks in Parry.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 149 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 35 - No Disintegrations[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidentalOutofTurn","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"F0cGoJwws7dKHq5I","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Second Wind","description":"Once per encounter, may use Second Wind incidental to heal strain equal to ranks in Second Wind.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"Jxe5ukackg1UcAgT","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent3":{"name":"Parry","description":"When hit by a melee attack, suffer 3 strain to reduce damage by 2 plus ranks in Parry.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 149 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 35 - No Disintegrations[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidentalOutofTurn","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"F0cGoJwws7dKHq5I","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Second Wind","description":"Once per encounter, may use Second Wind incidental to heal strain equal to ranks in Second Wind.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"Jxe5ukackg1UcAgT","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent5":{"name":"Conditioned","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Conditioned from Athletics and Coordination checks.

Most Mechanics would tell you they do both, and then get back to work.\n[P]The additional career skills of a Mechanic indicate his practical versatility: [B]Brawl, Mechanics[b] (of course, and this gives him the opportunity to have two starting ranks in the skill), [B]Piloting (Space),[b] and [B]Skulduggery[b]. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Pragmatic and tough are two key traits that come out of a Mechanic's talent tree, as are the many ways he is capable of fixing what's broken and being prepared for any mechanical contingencies that arise.\n\n[P]While it is relatively easy to find a Mechanic almost anywhere in the galaxy, it's considerably more difficult to find a good one, and even harder to find one that can be trusted. Ship captains will literally travel across systems to get to a Mechanic they can trust to do a good job for them, which is why Mechanics tend to be in high demand.\n\n[P]A Mechanic that's hooked up with the typical Player Character group has likely decided he doesn't want to spend all of his time in a work pit or engineering hangar. He probably wants to see a bit of the galaxy and get some flight time in. Fortunately, Mechanics tend to pick up a few things about how to take care of themselves in tough situations, and given a few minutes and some random devices, they may well cobble together a rather explosive means of dealing with real problems.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 89 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 85 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"ffwv9uegd6qn7fp8":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kqlakers1inbx4fz":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"s84upmb4ne9klvy8":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"po84cnrqzk41lh2e":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"bityroga4941u5u7":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"5elvjpfj46lw67jy":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"8yd4enkvv4ece5cn":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"64iqeer28tjjcz0d":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Gearhead","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Gearhead from Mechanics checks.

{"name":"Sleeper Agent","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4] Sleeper Agent – Ensuring Trust[h4]\nSpies must be able to tell convincing lies. Often, a lie only needs to hold up for a few seconds—just long enough for the agent to complete a crime. In some cases, the lie must be more convincing and survive much more detailed scrutiny. Sleeper Agents must be able to operate in isolation from their support network for months or even years at a time. During such missions, operatives should blend seamlessly into their host environments, never arousing even the slightest suspicion. Sustaining believable lies for this much time requires dedication so that no hint of their real identity ever emerges. For some Sleeper Agents, their artificial guises are so ingrained that it takes effort to emerge from them once a lengthy mission is finally over.\n[P]Sleeper Agents acquire [B]Charm, Cool, Discipline,[b] and [B]Knowledge (Education)[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the player may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]On a mission, the vast majority of Sleeper Agents' time involves working a mundane job that may seem unrelated to their objective. In a few cases, the job is a military one, but those assignments require extensive security checks. More often, the Sleeper Agent works a civilian job that may have military connections. The agent may even serve as a member of a criminal organization. Whichever is the case, the Sleeper Agent's duties offer peripheral access to a resource that is of great interest to the Rebellion. It is vitally important that agents remain constantly discreet about their true intentions.\n[P]All Sleeper Agents must be proficient in some profession that is not inherently related to uncovering military intelligence for the Rebellion. They might not need to be experts, but they must be able to convincingly assume an unremarkable civilian or military career. This act must be sustained for an extended period of time while the operatives wait to have their missions activated. Some missions focus entirely upon placing agents in critical places so that they can be activated to avert a currently unknown crisis. In these cases, the agents might pursue their cover career for years. Other missions have established timeframes or discrete objectives that the operative must pursue without raising suspicion.\n[P]Critically, Sleeper Agents must remain unflinchingly loyal to their cause. At the same time, they must be able to maintain the illusion that they are loyal to the enemy. In the case of extended assignments, they must build friendships and working relationships with their foes—relationships that they know they will eventually betray. Few individuals are capable of maintaining this level of duplicity without developing some level of emotional attachment. Such attachment incurs terrible risk, as it could lead to hesitation at a critical juncture.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{"w8b6zie27tcyufwc":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"pmffo33khfefwohq":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"18jwhilxwd5atksp":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"s22sd0vzzel9fv0c":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ifixi0ryug9tp2vb":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"fqsdjg754357y8kw":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Codebreaker","description":"Remove [SE] per rank in Codebreaker from checks to break codes or decrypt communications.

{"name":"Aggressor","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Aggressor[h4]\n\nThe Aggressor relies on fear to intimidate his opposition into surrender or retreat. Aggressors tend to be tough and dangerous combatants, able to dish out brutal damage to anyone who fights them, while surviving the same. They use their confident, terrifying attitudes to convey this to their opponents. Some Aggressors hope their enemies back down without a fight, but others fall into the trap of relishing the fear they inspire.\n\n[P]Aggressors acquire [B]Coercion, Knowledge (Underworld), Ranged (Light),[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These skills enable Aggressors to recognize the bravado shown by criminal enforcers and thugs. It also aids them in cowing these individuals, assuring these predators that the Force-sensitive character is a far scarier and more potent individual than they have previously faced.\n\n[P]Tempered by the Force, some characters who undertake this specialization prefer to use their abilities to intimidate foes into surrender so they don't have to kill needlessly. While they are extremely capable in this regard, they frequently learn the techniques required to cause the bare minimum of damage necessary. Precision is important, as every life still holds value in the Force.\n\n[P]When confronted by a foe that seems irredeemable, however, the Aggressor's attitude shifts appropriately. All elements of self-restraint are discarded, and the Aggressor is able to simply punish his foes, inflicting devastating blow after devastating blow. Often, opponents simply flee rather than engage an Aggressor. Stories told by survivors—and sometimes allies—add to the character's reputation, making it even easier to intimidate future enemies.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 99 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"fzhbc0h05l5xc4xh":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"p4nr03m2tzndrdxy":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"z9s9ihkshj2gug6c":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"evxb2ugtj1q9igmf":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"6fvcqkwpttmlg7q5":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ynrlcja72zbww9ek":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Intimidating","description":"May suffer a number of strain to downgrade difficulty of Coercion checks, or upgrade difficulty when targeted by Coercion checks, by an equal number.

The Jedi lean on these commanders to advise them, enforce discipline, and execute the Jedi's orders.\n[P]A Clone Commander leads a regiment of four battalions of four companies each, taking orders directly from the Jedi on the field. They must think large scale, advising the Jedi on tactical and strategic matters, questioning when appropriate, but following orders when commanded. They must also interpret those orders, making sure they can accomplish the Jedi's goals while keeping casualties low. Lastly, they must pay attention to logistics and supply lines, ensuring that their regiments can hold the territory they take or have the ability to wage an offensive.

{"name":"Pirate","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Pirate - Nefarious Opportunists[h4]\nPirates care about helping themselves, and they do not care how they do it. They'll lead a crew to attack well-stocked spaceships. They'll rescue a naive idealist to steal contraband so they can sell it at a profit. Some Pirates have even seen that there are greater potential reqards-such as ending the ever increasing Imperial stranglehold over their independance-in working as somewhat-reliable rebels.\n[P]The additional career skills a PC receives when taking the Pirate universal specialization are [B]Coercion, Deception, Knowledge (Underworld),[b] and [B]Skulduggery[b]. These PCs know the galaxy is a dangerous and unforgiving place, and are always ready to exploit this fact and make serious credits.\n[P]For these cunning \"entrepreneurs\" unafraid to break a few rules, take some risks and resort to violence, anyone else's gains can become their own. The first law of piracy is that everything belongs to whomever can take it. However, this is an honorable profession; it's just business, and never personal. At least, it isn't until someone else makes it personal.\n[P]While Pirates work for their own gain, the best opportunists require at least temporary support. Inside contacts, talented slicers, and reliable pilots can be invaluable-as are plenty of hired muscle to back up threats. Skilled Pirates are adept at manipulating those they work with (and anyone in their way) to achieve their goals, often via coercion and leveraging their dangerous reputations. Some might never need to fire a blaster, such is their terrifying renown, while others delight in violence that normal society does not allow.\n[P]Unrestricted by standard conventions of right and wrong, the methods that Pirates use can vary wildly. Taking what they want is easy when no one else is left standing, so violence is frequently a first resort. If violence alone can't work, or is impractical, they rely on cunning. Pirates might propose mutually beneficial agreements to secure assets essential to completing a job. Whether or not the deals are balanced or the Pirates even hold up their end is of little concern to them. This doesn't mean that come Pirates won't develop long-term arrangements, but often both parties are aware that such deals are strong only as long as both sides profit handsomely. Even so, most Pirates value their independence too much to be tied down for long, even to lucrative outsiders.\n[P]Regardless, Pirates sometimes find themselves aiding fledgling anti-Imperial cells. These desperate, outnumbered bands have few legal options for support. Many come to rely on the experience of Pirates for help-especially in learning how to survive outside the law and in finding unsavory but useful contacts. What might start as purely business dealings can grow to a more lasting association over exciting times, shared conflicts, and a few bottles of something jointly stolen. Whether a band of Pirates commits to a group of rebels for profit, shared aggression against the Empire, or pure boredom may never be known, but Pirates aid can keep such groups alive and fighting long after others have fallen.\n[P]Pirates can be duplicitous, conniving, violent con-artists, but they are almost always effective. Whether they are finding criminally-profitable jobs or manipulating their own comrades to make them more effective against the Empire, Pirates are constantly twisting situations to gain the most benefit. They almost always focus the benefit for themselves first, but sometimes it can spill over to their allies.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 104 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{"a9bbhoep2dhwlii5":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"asurz7ykmvoquit0":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ss2swvn06nkqjpoj":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"x1awyivoqosl9gdf":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"m67pqx908t8i1v27":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"b2dz289jydqm0qqn":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Black Market Contacts","description":"When purchasing illegal goods, may reduce rarity by 1 per rank of Black Market Contacts, increasing cost by 50 percent of base cost per reduction.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 132 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidental","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"9fZBEB8nm0CujVmw","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent2":{"name":"Quick Draw","description":"Once per round, draw or holster a weapon or accessible item as an incidental.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"WnFEG0VUywqagDXi","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Knows the Ropes","description":"Add [BO] to checks made to escape from restraints equal to ranks in Knowledge (Underworld).

{"name":"Vanguard","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Vanguard - Unrelenting Onslaught[h4]\nVanguards are first to the fight, Soldiers skilled in taking point and taking charge. While they generally do\nnot command in the traditional sense, their preferred\nmode of combat is to hit hard and fast, and thus allies\ntend to fall in behind them, if only so that they are\nnot left behind. This means that Vanguards shoulder a\ngreat deal of the risk in battle, but most would rather\ntake a blaster bolt than let a squadmate be shot. As a\nresult of taking so many hits over the course of their\nmilitary careers, the Vanguards who survive tend to be\nextremely tough.\n[P]Vanguards have [B]Athletics[b], [B]Cool[b], [B]Vigilance[b], and\n[B]Resilience[b] as additional career skills. If this is a character's starting specialization, he may choose two of\nthese skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Having both Cool and\nVigilance means that Vanguards are extremely unlikely\nto flinch or hesitate when the shots start flying, regardless of whether\nthey are launching an ambush or reacting\nto an unexpected move. Athletics reflects the\nphysical acumen of Vanguards, while Resilience\nstems from the long history of hits such characters\nhave likely taken.\n[P]On battlefields often dominated by massive walkers, sudden starfighter strikes, and orbital bombardments, standing still in the open can be a death sentence, and Vanguards know it. Rather than hunkering down and hoping to avoid the worst, Vanguards take\nthe battle directly to the enemy, seizing the initiative to end the battle before their foes even realize\nthat it has begun. They tend to favor rapid strikes,\narmored assaults, and shipboard actions that leave\nthe enemy reeling and unable to bring its arm or to\nbear. So long as they keep moving, their logic goes,\nthe enemy cannot hope to pin them down. Barriers\nto their entry, from blast doors to bunkers, are something to be smashed so that they can move on to the\nnext target. The Moving Target talent is particularly\nuseful when keeping mobile to stay alive, and makes\na Vanguard with the drop on the enemy extremely\ndifficult to bring down.\n[P]Off the field of battle, Vanguards are frequently\nquick to action as well Hesitation on the battlefield\nis often fatal, and many Vanguards apply this mentality to their other activities, trying to keep opponents.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 32 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{"tpzklxt1spqv3sb4":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"oc4r0n9e36d3o1tf":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"cpssrj1ishuxlxs4":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"lxg4zu1xnuiw7836":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"snikxr98dndb1da4":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"bav5ozd711v5whem":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"qhfytvvarjstma9o":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ooqx246lfht5624z":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Body Guard","description":"Once per round, perform the Body Guard maneuver to guard an engaged character.

He doesn't care one whit for rules or laws, except where he can use them to work an angle that either nets him a lot of credits or brings down an enemy. If he's really lucky—and he tends to have an unshakable faith in his luck—he'll manage both.\n\n[P]His dynamic nature is spelled out in the Scoundrel's additional career skills: [B]Charm, Cool, Deception,[b] and [B]Ranged (Light)[b]. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Combined with his talents, these skills make him formidable in a fight, useful in dealing with the underworld, and an individual simply not to be trusted.\n\n[P]Scoundrels fulfill many roles in the Outer Rim. Some are grifters, others are middle-men, and still others are simply thrill-seekers looking to see what they can get into next. Scoundrels tend to avoid taking charge of anything, but they are more than willing to ride the coattails of powerful people, often applying their unique skill set to help their employer in any number of ways. Scoundrels rarely put down roots for very long, and will always be looking for the next interesting thing to do (especially if it can make them some money).\n\n[P]In a Player Character group, the Scoundrel is a kind of all-purpose character. He's got enough underworld savvy and social ability to act as a \"face\" for the group, and he's no slouch in a fight. He may or may not be a pilot, but it's almost certain he's got many of the rogue-style abilities a group might need.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 84 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"0ehuung8w0fik2u8":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"tqzcckbd0nkyt9en":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"3ycl4byft6yy2ytp":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"izara1qnd2ne0a9c":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"soq5locrheut1m7n":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"dww2ge8ixih064ea":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4yj9f4i5a8onwmd3":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"oclpzj5p7vm8nnqe":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Black Market Contacts","description":"When purchasing illegal goods, may reduce rarity by 1 per rank of Black Market Contacts, increasing cost by 50 percent of base cost per reduction.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 132 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidental","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"9fZBEB8nm0CujVmw","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Convincing Demeanor","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Convincing Demeanor from any Deception or Skulduggery checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"JkBGqWp2M1MhktIh","attributes":{"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Skulduggery":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Quick Draw","description":"Once per round, draw or holster a weapon or accessible item as an incidental.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"WnFEG0VUywqagDXi","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Rapid Reaction","description":"Suffer a number of strain to add an equal number of [SU] to initiative checks.

The Scout is the professional for the task, trained to survey and survive, gathering all of the information he can while keeping his head attached to his body. While bravery in combat is one thing, there can be no denying the fearlessness of anyone willing to touch down on a completely unknown planet and trudge about with only scanners and his wits to discover its secrets.\n[P]A Scout knows his way around in any environment, and he's both tough and knowledgeable enough to make the most of his situation. His additional Career skills make his job much easier: [B]Athletics, Medicine, Piloting (Planetary),[b] and [B]Survival[b]. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Most Scouts are skilled at: covering any ground (or lack thereof); how to find what to eat and where to sleep; and how to survey an area and gather all the needed data. Scouts are often excellent at driving or piloting atmospheric craft as well.\n\n[P]There are plenty of Scouts that work either for the Empire or for corporations that actively seek out and survey planets for possible exploitation. They normally work with survey teams with excellent support and resources. Independent Scouts—like the one a player is likely to play—operate with a great deal more autonomy. They will find smaller operations to work with, ones with looser rules and regulations that let them operate more as they choose. Living by his toughness and wits as he must, a Scout will be surprisingly effective in most situations. After all, adapting to the unknown is a trademark talent of any Scout.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 72 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 98 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"vhz2mh586xmlz05q":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"7gzi2sku4eel1n0b":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"2sqhdz9ua9b9jtfi":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"gjaveddwqhpg4vwr":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"u1e3nylms22syt7g":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"a0pve8crotnbas20":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"h0scm4wqiucmpj0p":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"oxlf2bupnsrdx2o8":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Rapid Recovery","description":"When healing strain after an encounter, heal 1 additional strain per rank of Rapid Recovery.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"bQXTPoPl2EToZkJk","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Stalker","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Stalker to all Stealth and Coordination checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"XPx0Mg7hTNo707t1","attributes":{"Coordination":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Stealth":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Short Cut","description":"During a chase; add [BO] per rank in Shortcut to any checks made to catch or escape an opponent.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"xXAsyR5vn1zSilMT","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Forager","description":"Remove up to [SE][SE] from skill checks to find food, water, or shelter.

They can handle themselves in a fight, to be sure, but prefer to accomplish their objectives through savvy, intimidation, blackmail, and straightforward threats. If they need to fight, however, they can brawl with the best.\n\n[P]Enforcers receive [B]Brawl, Coercion, Knowledge (Underworld),[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending experience. While most Hired Guns focus almost exclusively on combat, Enforcers have a focus in intimidation and both learned and instinctual criminal knowledge. Although they have access to Brawl and other combat skills, for the most part Enforcers are not mindless thugs, but canny operators well-versed in the ins and outs of the criminal underworld. When it comes to navigating this world, few are as knowledgeable or adept as Enforcers. Even when visiting a new planet, Enforcers adapt quickly, picking up instinctively on subtle cues and local slang.\n\n[P]In most criminal organizations, Enforcers fill the dual role of hired muscle and the \"face\" of a criminal organization. The Enforcer brings a criminal syndicate's message to the streets, then ensures that message is followed (and punishes those who stray). Enforcers should have no trouble finding work, whether on the uncivilized worlds of the Outer Rim or in the shady underworlds of the Core planets. Enforcers are a natural fit for organized crime syndicates, where they collect debts and ensure everyone shows the proper respect and deference to bosses and leaders. Many Enforcers practice a certain subtlety, avoiding police forces while enforcing the rules of gangs and criminal organizations.\n\n[P]While most Enforcers have a fondness for violence, they also display a degree of self-control. Violence is a tool in the Enforcer's arsenal, and not an end in itself. Unlike some Hired Gun characters, an Enforcer is more likely to try words before violence, though these words may be laced with venom and the threat of imminent violence. However, an Enforcer must always be ready to fight.\n\n[P]In a group, Enforcers can fulfill much the same combat role as other Hired Guns, but can also take the lead in negotiations and social interactions. With their Knowledge (Underworld) and Streetwise skills, Enforcers can act as guides when the group delves into the criminal underworld, a realm as dangerous for the unprepared as any natural environment. A savvy Enforcer can actually help the group to avoid unnecessary fights by knowing what to say during tense negotiations with dangerous criminals. Enforcers are more likely to take on a social interaction role than some other Hired Guns, since their skills can be put to use negotiating jobs, finding work, and managing social encounters.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Dangerous Covenants[h4]","attributes":{"9xafuno0fsb7ejwp":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"wel1qumr6yds8cyn":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"vp668tmt1cmqzrcr":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"t6pxs4mtjhku27o1":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"p19ty4l679e4xze0":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"vr8xemlw1uby646b":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent1":{"name":"Intimidating","description":"May suffer a number of strain to downgrade difficulty of Coercion checks, or upgrade difficulty when targeted by Coercion checks, by an equal number.

{"name":"Entrepreneur","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Entrepreneur - The Burden of Vision[h4]\n\nEntrepreneurs know that there is only one thing worth investing in—the future. Entrepreneurs are not unlike explorers in the world of business; they want to be the first to open up new markets, to revolutionize industrial practices, or to create new service industries people hadn't realized they needed, but once sampled, cannot live without.\n\n[P]Entrepreneurs receive [B]Discipline, Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Underworld),[b] and [B]Negotiation[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he gains one free rank in each of two of these skills of his choice, without spending experience. While the Entrepreneur is willing to bully, charm, or mislead others to achieve his ends, he prefers to rely on negotiations, bringing to bear facts, graphs, and projections for the future. In this way the Entrepreneur is similar to the Scholar. However, unlike Scholars, the Entrepreneur operates under the assumption that every problem can be overcome with a big enough credit stick.\n\n[P]Entrepreneurs may be free with their money, but they are never wasteful, and they are always looking for ways to cut costs, even if it skirts regulations. Most savvy businesspeople know that if one only plays by the rules, then one can only ever be as successful as the rules allow. Since the rules are usually written by the established corporations the Entrepreneur competes against, he believes the rules exist solely as a means to restrict progress, stifle innovation, and suppress competition. In short, rules were made to be broken. Even the most upstanding businessperson occasionally contracts operatives for industrial espionage or corporate intelligence gathering, and even if he morally objects to that behavior, he needs to know how to defend against it.\n\n[P]It is said that a sucker is born every second, and the Entrepreneur takes great pains to make certain he is never one of them. In all of his dealings, the Entrepreneur must remain vigilant against conversational traps laid by opponents during delicate negotiations. Preparedness is always a part of the plan, so that risk is mitigated and no circumstances result in absolute failure.\n\n[P]Every group can benefit from counting an Entrepreneur among its number. Their ability to negotiate a favorable deal in any number of circumstances, and the resources at their disposal, make Entrepreneurs invaluable members of the team. They make excellent leaders, and any party who allows an Entrepreneur to negotiate on its behalf will be pleased with the results. The Entrepreneur can also act as team quartermaster, outfitting the group with specialized, hard-to-find equipment with little notice, and both his pool of contacts and credit pouch are deep enough to keep the party informed on almost any subject.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 -

These problems include matters of supply, housing, transport, effective weaponry and defenses, and a host of others. The people they turn to for those creative solutions are those who are trained and driven to identify a need and seek out a technical solution to it—in other words, Scientists.\n\n[P]The additional career skills for Scientists are [B]Computers, Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Lore),[b] and [B]Medicine[b]. If this is a first specialization, the PC gains a free rank in two of these skills. Unsurprisingly, Scientists are among the most educated people in the galaxy, with a wide range of advanced knowledge in areas such as medicine and celestial mechanics.\n\n[P]Most Scientists pursue their work in labs, rarely venturing out into the greater galaxy. Their lives are spent on theories and research, pondering the latest mysteries of the universe comfortably away from conflict and strife. Some Scientists, however, seek the satisfaction of bringing their theories and their ideas into the galaxy in order to help others. They design solutions, help create of the technology to implement those solutions, and actively test and use those solutions alongside others who are also trying to help make life better.\n\n[P]Though Alliance officials prefer to keep Scientists in the rear echelons, as far away from danger and risk as possible, there are more than a few who insist on being the ones to test their new devices directly in the held. Further, some Scientists sign on with the Rebellion for the express purpose of taking the fight to the Empire; they're just as prepared to fire a blaster at a stormtrooper as they are to devise a way to improve the power flow for that blaster to do more damage.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 87 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"032xduu4wio3gm16":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"njkc9utppdjq4voz":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"zac62fkanune7cnv":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"qi73szjh9uxx38xm":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Knowledge Specialization","description":"When acquired, choose 1 Knowledge skill.

{"name":"Executioner","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Executioner - Dealing Efficient Death[h4]\nSeekers often focus on survival in hostile settings where they must rely solely on their own abilities. Such self reliance can also  be reflected in their combat abilities, as each shot or strike must end a battle as swiftly as possible. Merely wounding or dissuading a foe is not sufficient in these cases, as often only one party can leave the encounter alive. Executioners embody this focus on precise lethality. Many become feared across systems for their effective means of eliminating any threat that requires removal. Determining which threats deserve their deadly and personal attention, though,  can make for complex judgment calls. Such decisions and the methods by which they render them can also lead Executioners down the path to the dark side.\n[P]Executioners are perhaps the embodiment of the Seeker career as apex predator, and they excel at the art of death. While other careers and specializations can produce effective fighters. Executioners are more concerned with maximizing the damage they inflict to ensure a quick, definitive end to their conflicts. Given their emerging connection to the Force there are few who can match these lethal characters' ability to achieve this goal.\n[P]Executioners receive [B]Discipline[b], [B]Melee[b], [B]Perception[b], and [B]Ranged (Heavy)[b] as additional career skills, reflecting their deadly and efficient application of violence. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Others might view Executioners as brutal killers, but this is a simplistic view. Killing is often the outcome of combat, but Executioners might attempt to avoid conflict altogether as their aim is only for a fatal end for their target. This could even mean a target is eliminated by long range fire or a decisive lightsaber strike before even becoming aware of any danger. When eliminating one saves hundreds of others or frees entire villages from suffering, many Executioners see their work as perhaps distasteful, but certainly necessary.\n[P]Executioners are not always grim, dispassionate assassins, though many are driven by intellect rather than emotion. Some may view their calling as a righteous one, celebrating each threat they remove before it can harm others. Others might see each lethal act as a step toward redemption for past sins. Inflicting death should never be an easy act, however. Those who trivialize it or become too emotionally attached to their goals are at risk of becoming enthralled by the dark side of the Force—which some Executioners might not realize until far too late.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 24 -

{"name":"Martial Artist","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Martial Artist[h4]\nFrom the Kage Warriors of Quarzite to the enforcers of the Black Sun, organizations and cultures across the galaxy have developed their own unique hand-to-hand combat styles to use their species' physiology to greatest effect. Over decades, centuries, and millennia, these combat forms become more than mere means of inflicting violence; generations of practitioners work to make them into art forms, philosophies, and ways of life. A desire to practice self-defense can become a belief in the value of self-betterment and the innate potential of others, though not all ideologies develop along such lines. More than a few Bounty Hunters have picked up techniques from martial arts styles across  the galaxy to help their hunts. Some are shinning examples of their school's philosophies and traditions, but others are disgraced students, or have never even trained formally, earning their skills through hard experience on the battlefield.\n[P]In addition to the Bounty Hunter's eight career skills, the Martial Artist receives [B]Athletics[b], [B]Brawl[b], [B]Coordination[b], and [B]Discipline[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the Martial Artist may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]A Martial Artist benefits first and foremost from a high Brawn rating to empower the Brawl skill. However, Willpower is an extremely useful secondary characteristic, as it not only gives the Martial Artist the higher strain threshold needed to activate the specialization's many talents that use strain as a resource, but also the ability to face intimidating foes up close without flinching. Further, talents like Mind Over Matter benefit from a higher Willpower, and let the Martial Artist fight even longer without becoming exhausted. Finally, the  Martial Artist benefits greatly from investing in the Coordination skill, as talents like Martial Grace and Coordination Dodge let the Martial Artist supplement raw strength with finesse both offensively and defensively.\n[P]Unlike characters from most other specializations built around close-quarters combat, Martial Artists does not need a weapon to fight competently. Martial Artists generally value precision over brute strength and strive to execute efficient unarmed strikes. By wasting as little energy as possible, they can deliver extremely forceful blows even when unarmed. This is reflected in talents like Precision Strike, which lets Martial Artists exhaust and weaken foes as they see fit rather than by chance. Martial Artists also seek to leverage their enemies' strength against them in battle with talents like Overbalance, which allows them to throw foes off-balance after they attack. Martial Artists also have access to Parry to mitigate damage, and can even use Parry when unarmed.\n[P]This unique combination of precise offense and controlled defense allows Martial Artists to contend with some of the toughest fighters in the galaxy. Of course, not every battle is worth fighting, and a trained Martial Artist knows to assess not only the enemy but also the situation before deciding whether to join the fray. Many schools of martial arts teach the idea that fights are to be avoided, and that the ideal way to win a battle is to avoid having it in the  first place.

The Gadgeteer excels at presenting himself as a one-person battle force, at least for a short time. Using both the latest tech and his own personally-modified gear, a Bounty Hunter with this specialization can be hard to stop.\n[P]Gadgeteers add the skills [B]Brawl, Coercion, Mechanics,[b] and [B]Ranged (Light)[b] to their repertoire of class skills, making them ranged combat experts, effective technicians, and masters of surveillance. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Gadgeteer talents lean heavily towards gear use, taking down targets, and adapting to tough situations.\n\n[P]Gadgeteer-specialized Bounty Hunters are in many ways the ultimate hybrid of tech expert and combatant; for smaller groups, this may be a perfect choice.

{"name":"Navigator","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Navigator - Guiding to Safety[h4]\nSeekers are often at the forefront of exploration, pushing back the edges of the unknown across planets and systems throughout the galaxy. Most view the mission itself as more important than the plotting needed to undertake it, and determining its best method and route unimportant when compared to what awaits at the destination. Others, though, see these as perhaps at least as important, and certainly more personally rewarding. Navigators represent those Seekers who devote themselves fully to these aspects from charting hyperspace passages or plotting overland routes. No matter the environment, none can match Navigators when they set about deciding a course. When Navigators use the Force their abilities might even appear more reliant on fantastic luck than skill to the uninitiated.\n[P]Navigators are often excellent pilots as well, but these Seekers are generally more interested in the best way for their vehicle to arrive safely an expeditiously than in its firepower or maneuverability. Some of these individuals may have spent their entire lives in space, moving from ship to ship or working one specific area filled with hazardous asteroids or nests of black holes. Most travel extensively, regardless of their origins, always seeking out new uncharted regions in need of their abilities.\n[P]Navigators receive [B]Astrogation[b], [B]Knowledge (Outer Rim)[b], [B]Perception[b] and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills, representing their skills at locating and mapping out pathways, both planetary and stellar. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gin one free rank in each without spending starting experience. The addition of Astrogation allows Navigators to truly excel in outer space, where they can help ensure the group arrives speedily and accurately to distant star systems.\n[P]Navigators are also excellent on planets, charting routes over sea, land, and air, as well as even orbital voyages. Their skills are especially critical on uncharted worlds, but they are  also valuable in urban settings, which can be as unfathomable as any dense jungle or endless steppe. When the PCs need to find the fastest, safest, or least conspicuous way to reach their destination, Navigators are whom they turn to invaluable in chases, whether the PCs are trying to run down their quarry or escape pursuit, Navigators can give a group the edge it needs by locating the most efficient route.\n[P]Navigators are often driven to find such routes on their own, and might become irritated when inferior passages are used. Not resting until the best path is discovered and followed, they soon become bored when success is achieved, as there is no challenge in following an established route. For some Navigators, this is a never-ending quest, and they are always seeking to shave just one light year from a hyperspace lane, or an hour from a city crossing, something that can always happen as they become more proficient with the Force. The Force can also allow them to offer guidance of a less tactical and more spiritual nature at times as well, something that can also aid the PCs in their adventures.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Savage Spirits[h4]","attributes":{"g7xce5yzs7us0j0a":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"85r6au6suf4lbjft":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ddlhyc9yykbaho4r":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"c9wmlkqb9m2vpxf2":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"les11gcitdge7tsx":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"07j3lrlb4e34i3il":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Studious Plotting","description":"When making a Streetwise or Survival skill check to navigate on a world, the character may use Intellect instead of Cunning.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 31 - Savage Spirits[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"G5iuhwZsOLWu39MO","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Expert Tracker","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Expert Tracker from checks to find tracks or track targets.

{"name":"Peacekeeper","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Peacekeeper[h4]\n\nAcross the galaxy, there are always tyrants, and those unlucky enough to suffer under their rule. Some Guardians take direct action through military force to attempt to overthrow such despots. Other Guardians see wars ravaging planets and harming the weak and defenseless. They step in to defend those innocents, and enforce peace at the tip of a lightsaber. These Guardians are often known as Peacekeepers.\n\n[P]Peacekeepers acquire [B]Discipline, Leadership, Perception,[b] and [B]Piloting (Planetary)[b] as additional career skills, and if this is the PC's starting specialization, the PC gains one rank in each of two of these skills. This combination ensures that they can recognize threats and respond to them in an effective and timely manner. Skilled Peacekeepers must be able to effectively delegate assignments to allies while reserving themselves to confront the challenges for which they are most adept.\n\n[P]Many Peacekeepers only assume this specialization after they have been thrust into a position of authority—sometimes repeatedly. Because of their naturally protective personalities, these Guardians want to do everything in their power to protect their friends. Often, they decide the best choice is to become the best leader they can, out of a sense of responsibility rather than a desire for power.\n\n[P]Characters who pursue the Peacekeeper's path seldom limit their activities to a single region. Often once one region has been pacified or a tyrant overthrown, a Peacekeeper sets his sight on the next challenge and leads his friends and fellow freedom fighters to overcome it. Under the shadow of the Empire, Peacekeepers are always needed.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 75 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"dnizq5ll4b8exp3a":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"20re80v5l1h4wsu1":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"5j24kv60bhnnjdrd":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"iqhobr8tbnsn1js2":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ejiehd5exeda2kbx":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"2jf025sljzuums3a":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"bes2damdsyl873rw":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"mx4y317hkrpop8ap":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Command","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Command when making Leadership checks.

Protectors ensure these innocents never come to harm. Few are tougher than a Protector, and even fewer can get through his guard to attack those he defends. Even if his charges do suffer harm, the Protector possesses basic medical knowledge to heal their wounds.\n\n[P]Protectors gain the additional career skills of [B]Athletics, Medicine, Ranged (Light),[b] and [B]Resilience[b]. If this is the characters starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. This combination enables the character to assist those who are in need during a crisis. These skills complement many of the talent selections, so that the Protector remains capable of effectively shielding others from suffering harm without sacrificing his own capabilities.\n\n[P]Protectors could be considered bodyguards, but their efforts are seldom limited to protecting a single individual. Instead, Protectors are more likely to defend the needy on a larger scale. Often, they function as rescue workers, using their medical knowledge to stabilize injuries in the field and then providing additional protection. In other cases, Protectors may shelter refugees or other victims fleeing terrible situations. holding the line until the innocents can escape to safety. When a Protector does defend a single individual, It is likely because a great threat—even another Force user—pursues the person.\n\n[P]Some Protectors might come to master their abilities while working in a military or law enforcement role. Some Force techniques might manifest spontaneously as they instinctively act to keep companions safe. This could be particularly relevant for individuals who have not recognized their connection to the Force. Its presence might enable them to save an ally from danger in a seemingly inexplicable fashion. However, once these individuals realize the power they have, they must decide whether to continue their career and keep it a secret, or leave the life they've known and explore their new abilities.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 76 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"78r739jh1ex7dhv1":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"xgcx10r7jre8j8zw":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"iykzf37uvahmcqt4":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"3dva47o1ou2hc82x":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4r5kevj5nrpumdpr":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"eatd8sbixd6ey9g5":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"35dcc4rod396wc7v":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"inv0t2dm00rn56ah":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent1":{"name":"Body Guard","description":"Once per round, perform the Body Guard maneuver to guard an engaged character.

{"name":"Juyo Berserker","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Juyo Berserker - Controlled Rage[h4]\n\nIn the latter days of the Jedi Order, Padawans studied six forms of lightsaber combat, ensuring familiarity with all. Few Jedi, however, were trusted to study the seventh, the highly restricted Juyo form. The Juyo Berserker is a Warrior who fights with this dangerously aggressive and ferocious manner of lightsbaber combat. A Juyo Berserker could have formal training in Form VII, but the specialization can also apply to a self-taught fighter who harnesses natural rage and ferocity to overcome foes with an all-out offensive.\n[P]Juyo Berserkers receive [B]Coercion, Discipline, Lightsaber,[b] and [B]Melee[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the player chooses two of these sk ills and gains one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. While Juyo is undoubtedly an aggressive form of combat by the standards of the Jedi, it nonetheless requires at least the modicum of control necessary to wield a lightsaber effectively and-reIatively- safeIy. Compared to the other lightsaber forms in use by the Jedi in the latter days of the Republic, however, Juyo is reckless. Walking this fine line is not dissimilar from the way in which Juyo practitioners balance dangerously close to the dark side of the Force. \n[P]While a Juyo practitioner may appear calm, the form requires intense emotions to fuel its rapid, unpredictable lightsaber combat. A able, powerful strikes. Some Juyo Berserker. particularly adherents, could have formal training in Form VII,b ut the specialization can also apply to a self-taught fighter who harnesses natural rage and ferocity to overcome foes with an all-out offensive.\n\n[P]Juyo Berserkers receive Coercion , Discipline, lightsaber, and Melee as additional career skills.\n\n[P]If this is the character's starting specialization, the player chooses two of these skills and gains one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. While Juyo is undoubtedly an aggressive form of combat by the standards of the Jedi, it nonetheless requires at least the modicum of control necessary to wield a lightsaber effectively and - relatively safely compared to the other lightsaber forms in use by the Jedi in the latter days of the Republic. However, Juyo is reckless, walking this fine line is not dissimilar from the way in which Juyo practitioners balance dangerously close to the Dark Side of the Force.\n\n[P]While a Juyo practitioner may appear calm , the form requires intense emotions to fuel its rapid, unpredictable, powerful strikes. Some Juyo Berserkers-particularly adherents of the Jedi Code, which calls for tranquility and detachment-conceal the emotions raging below the surface. Others, including Sith, fully embrace the anger that drives Juyo and grants it power, snarling like frenzied animals as they lay into their opponents.\n\n[P]For Force sensitives in the age of the Empire, it is all too easy to give in to frustration, anger, and hate when forced into a confrontation. They might unknowingly find themselves mimicking the Juyo style. These sentients might be aware of the conflict raging within them-the struggle between unbridled emotion and stability-or they might remain dangerously ignorant of the path to the dark side of the Force.\n[P]A Juyo Berserker focuses on offense nearly to the exclusion of all else. This approach leaves the Berserker vulnerable should an opponent find the opportunity to counterattack, and so a Juyo practitioner must match the foe's skill in pure ferocity. Juyo fighters particularly risk being overwhelmed by greater numbers; a Berserker must be able to lay about with the blistering relentlessness of many Warriors-or of the deadly predator from which the form draws its name.\n[P]Jedi who practiced Juyo were careful to balance inner darkness with the tranquility offered by the light side of the Force. It was in this way that Mace Windu developed the Vaapad variant, a form that allowed him to channel his inner darkness toward positive outcomes, to harness his anger without allowing it to control him. For Warriors bereft of the doctrines of the Jedi this balance is difficult. Without it, a tragic outcome could be all but inevitable.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{"ggry6d37nzjrbxq5":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"o951wy96qb9k7z2l":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"b6lywv61bw7rdl82":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"b0aemb2lgo605ney":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ie2oc076hdmzq8j0":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"4buphov8gbtudb2y":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"nt8xqmbdb1cnz3u6":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"36dy7xo2q6uv0ubz":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent1":{"name":"Parry","description":"When hit by a melee attack, suffer 3 strain to reduce damage by 2 plus ranks in Parry.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 149 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 35 - No Disintegrations[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidentalOutofTurn","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"F0cGoJwws7dKHq5I","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Intimidating","description":"May suffer a number of strain to downgrade difficulty of Coercion checks, or upgrade difficulty when targeted by Coercion checks, by an equal number.

{"name":"Scavenger","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Scavenger[h4]\nAs the Clone Wars erupt across the galaxy, there are many beings who have no interest in which side wins or loses. Scavengers have always existed in the Outer Rim, but during wartime, any individual might find themself lurking among the wreckage of droids and vehicles, salvaging valuables. For this reason, sentients from all walks of life might become Scavengers and learn to turn damaged or forgotten technology into profit on the black market, whether dealing in individual scanners and blasters or salvaging entire starships.\n\n[H4]SURVIVING ON DESTRUCTION[h4]\n\n[P]To venture out into a ruinous battlefield requires great courage, and only the most daring survivalists succeed at deriving profit from the wreckage of warfare. The dangers of a former battleground—from shattered tanks and unstable munitions to not-quite-disabled battle droids—are enough of a deterrence that most Scavengers find themselves working alone. The isolation and danger give anyone who chooses such a life great tenacity. The pay is usually better than the rate for any other work they could find, and the freedom is liberating.\n\n[P]Scavengers receive [B]Mechanics, Perception, Streetwise,[b] and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills. These skills are honed by constant forays into burned out factories or the hulking wrecks of starships, where local predators or malfunctioning battle droids might at any time emerge with deadly intent.\n\n[P]It is the ability to find treasure within the detritus of the Republic and the Separatists that draws individuals to such dangerous endeavors. A Scavenger is a master of improvisation. They often refurbish The technology they find in new and innovative ways to either sell on the black market or use for their own purposes. They are as much inventors as they are survivors, creating handmade and unique equipment that only they know how to use.\n\n [P]Not all of a Scavenger's discoveries are from the wreckage of war, however. Occasionally a battle unearths ancient relics or technology from before even the Republic, or a tip or rumor puts a Scavenger's skills to the test as they venture into territory unseen for generations. Instead of recovering the wreckage of a Republic or Separatist war machine, they may find themselves in the possession of a device so old that it would be priceless to academics or religious leaders—a device that can do things that no other technology can replicate.\n\n[P]If a Scavenger doesn't find their own use for a broken hull or circuit board, an extensive network within the black market offers plenty of ways to turn a profit on it. For every innovator willing to venture into danger for their parts, there are a dozen smugglers and technicians who would rather trade credits for safety and buy whatever materials a Scavenger can recover. This means that every piece of tech or wreckage is potentially valuable to someone. A reliable Scavenger can build up relationships with experienced fences that lead to improved profits and information that wouldn't be available any other way.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 33 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","attributes":{"or3d8zws4vovkx7q":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"php9lz3cbyb3h7ck":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"7luzvczfyevq42gh":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kqaxprtpo5k1t70p":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"6qpmm8wb929262yg":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"itrrg2vh78r3wmx3":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"mgzzjeve18arc0bz":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"nv57j5u4tht1d3ve":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Forager","description":"Remove up to [SE][SE] from skill checks to find food, water, or shelter.

{"name":"Warden","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Warden - The Daunting Defender[h4]\nWhether they wield the power of the Force consciously or not, Wardens know that they have been gifted with power. But more importantly, they know that they must wield this might to perform a necessary duty, subduing those who would abuse that same power to harm the Warden's friends and allies. While Guardians of all stripes might be driven by a desire to create a fairer world, the concept of justice is especially important to Wardens. The job of punishing the wicked is frequently a thankless one, especially in the era of the Empire, when the ruling regime is so deeply corrupt. Many Wardens see this burden as inevitable; after all, it is their role to make sure evil is stripped of the means to threaten their chosen allies, not to be loved for these efforts.\n[P]The Warden is unique among Guardian specializations in being focused specifically on weakening enemies rather than just bolstering allies. In some ways, this specialization is the mirror image of the Aggressor. Both wield fear as a weapon, but the Warden uses dread to weaken foes' strikes rather than make them more vulnerable to attacks, and relies on counterattacking instead of striking first. What a Warden lacks in raw toughness as compared to a Protector or Armorer, this unique Guardian makes up for with the ability to control foes options by restricting their movement, inflicting strain upon them and intimidating them into submission.\n[P]To assist in their task of identifying and subduing threats to their allies, Wardens have [B]Brawl, Coercion, Discipline and Knowledge (Underworld)[b] as additional career skills. If this is the characters stating specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Wardens are suited to taking major roles on and off the battlefield, thanks to their specialization's focus on Coercion. While using intimidation as a primary social tool can have consequences for the character's morality, many unnecessary fights can be avoided if potential foes are too afraid to draw weapons against a Warden. In battle, Wardens shine in close quarters, where foes must approach to attack and thus suffer the consequences of engaging such frightening enemies. Wardens do what is needed to give their allies the best chance of survival in a harsh galaxy, and if this includes some unsavory tasks, so be it.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Keeping the Peace[h4]","attributes":{"v0n7z8gkcblj0p5k":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"nlbt30x8vds6kbvv":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"leggeupqzyqeabr6":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"8cbxrb9cabt5t5nf":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"edav2h77v4n3i53b":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"wnjc17u50zh9274p":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent2":{"name":"Intimidating","description":"May suffer a number of strain to downgrade difficulty of Coercion checks, or upgrade difficulty when targeted by Coercion checks, by an equal number.

Fear lets it maintain order and authority over the countless beings in its thrall. The Agitator's primary goal is to remove that fear and replace it with anger, or courage, or a sense of righteousness—whatever it takes to get the people to rise up, take up arms, reject Palpatine's tyranny, and restore freedom and justice to the galaxy.\n\n[P]For Agitators, [B]Coercion, Deception, Knowledge (Underworld),[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] are all added as career skills. So long as this is the first specialization for the PC, he gains a free rank in two of these four skills. Agitators often bully the bullies to move them out of the way, and when they are able to get the people to follow them, they know how to lead. Understanding the ways of the streets is also vital to survival and success.\n\n[P]Most Agitators come by the calling through hardship and suffering. Their own personal tragedies at the hands of their oppressors drive them to call upon others to resist injustice and authoritarianism. Some are more altruistic in nature, sufficiently moved,by the suffering of others to take action and rouse the people to a cause in which they can believe. Only those with charisma and will in sufficient quantities can truly succeed in this dangerous and demanding course.\n\n[P]Many in the Alliance's upper levels consider Agitators a necessary evil; they are not keen to move populations of untrained civilians to go to war against the Empire's stormtroopers and other resources, yet they accept that, ultimately, it will take the entire galaxy doing just that if victory is to be achieved. When possible, Agitators are supported by other Alliance operatives, and a plan to arm and support the populace is usually in place before the Agitator goes to work.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 80 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"w1egr9err9rausta":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"g8s2d11p7mufd2pp":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"cplfj7wmt236fmp4":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"to0bnuont1dxt4u8":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"xl8vgprllvqqg0vg":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"8r4iwxpx8m68z02a":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Plausible Deniability","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Plausible Deniability from all Coercion and Deception checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"JV0sdFJNxWKFJene","attributes":{"Coercion":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Nobody's Fool","description":"May upgrade difficulty of incoming Charm, Coercion, or Deception checks once per rank of Nobody's Fool.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"R94udJt3yVpNQXv3","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Intimidating","description":"May suffer a number of strain to downgrade difficulty of Coercion checks, or upgrade difficulty when targeted by Coercion checks, by an equal number.

{"name":"Imperial Academy Cadet","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Imperial Academy Cadet - Rebellious Students[h4]\nThe Empire trains cadets to be effective and unquestioning soldiers. To its dismay, some of its most promising students are not willing to blindly obey. For many of the former aspiring Imperial pilots, officers, and stormtroopers who have deserted after gaining firsthand exposure to the Empire's practices, the Empire is an undeniable evil that must be opposed.\n[P]The additional career skills a PC receives when taking the Imperial Academy Cadet universal specialization are [B]Knowledge (Warfare), Leadership, Piloting (Space),[b] and [B]Ranged (Light)[b]. Having left their training institutions at some point in their past, these PCs are ready to fight against an Empire they once believed in, but now believe only that it must be overthrown.\n[P]To many individuals in these times, the Empire represents stability and order. It is responsible for having saved them from the Seperatists and the traitorous Jedi Order. The Imperial military, specifically, offers opportunities to serve that body in addition to the promise of patriotic fulfillment, exploration, and power. For those who haven't experienced the Empire's oppression, these can be powerful motivators to join up. Many adventurous souls desiring to escape the inevitability of a life without excitement or advancement have looked to the Imperial academies as a way to venture into the wider galaxy. Depending on the academy, however, even getting accepted can be a highly competitive affair, in which only the most naturally talented candidates have a chance-unless, of course, a candidate's family is connected.\n[P]Once a cadet is accepted, the glowing veneer of the Empire can begin to flake away. While cadets have the opportunity to gain knowledge in a variety of fields, the study of warfare is the most heavily emphasized. A select few are groomed to become pilots, but many only benefit from the combat training to become stormtroopers. During training, instructors often encourage and even reward peer sabotage in order to foster callous behavior and direct their charges' loyalty only to the Empire. Despite this practice, unyielding cadets occasionally emerge who did not resort to such underhanded tactics and refused to be properly molded during training. When these cadets come to the attention of their instructors, however, it is not uncommon for them to suddenly vanish.\n[P]For some who remain, knowing that their life will consist of following strict orders, regardless of the harm to peaceful civilians, quenches any desire to continue. After participating in theoretical or training operations to suppress unruly citizens, it becomes impossible for such cadets to ignore these operations in practice. For those who abandon the military but don't rebel immediately, the continued abuse they witness can be more than enough to motivate them to join the resistance movement. A few rebel cells have been known to assist disillusioned cadets in their defections. After fleeing their academy, former cadets are able to see the transgressions they may not have noticed before joining.\n[P]Imperial Academy Cadets are effective agents against the Empire because their training helps them to anticipate and exploit the Imperials' common tactics. Any mechanical blueprint a rogue cadet has been exposed to becomes a liability to the Empire. Any glimpsed prototypes lose their element of surprise, and any protocol learned can be exploited for covert missions.

{"name":"Trailblazer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Trailblazer - Unseen Paths[h4]\nWhen facing a numerically superior enemy with access to better weapons, armor, and supplies,\nan army must leverage absolutely every advantage\npossible. The Soldiers of the Alliance to Restore the\nRepublic have grown accustomed to fighting while outnumbered and outgunned, and have honed their wits\nto compensate and regain the advantage against the\nEmpire. One area in which rebel Soldiers frequently\nhave the edge is in knowledge of the terrain and how\nto use it. Even storm troopers, the supposed elite of the\nEmpire, frequently fall prey to its rigid modes of thinking, and Trailblazers can use their superior knowledge\nof the terrain and unorthodox tactics to surprise and\noverwhelm their foes.\n[P]Catching the enemy off guard is one of the oldest and most diverse tactics in the galaxy, and Trailblazers seek to turn it to their advantage at every turn. To this end, a Trailblazer receives [B]Knowledge (Outer Rim)[b], [B]Perception[b], [B]Stealth[b] and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills. If this is a character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain on free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Survival makes the Trailblazer better at tracking foes and setting clever traps, while Stealth helps in avoiding enemies who might uncover the Trailblazer's presence.\n[P]Trailblazers tend to favor patience and indirect solutions, pitting the foe against the wilderness or using the features of the terrain to eliminate enemy advantages. Heavy walkers cannot function in the confines of a forest, for instance nor can massive infantry surges push through urban environments without exposing themselves to risk. Trailblazers work to make the best of cover and prefer to fight on their own turf, where they can turn every piece of their knowledge to their advantage. The Cunning Snare talent, in particular, shines here, giving the Trailblazer the ability to set up a devastating trap for unsuspecting foes. while this talent takes some setup to use, the payout can be considerable, levelling a fight with a numerically superior or better-equipped foe. The Trailblazer can even use this talent without advanced supplies, using cleverness and woodcraft to overcome dire situations if the PCs are ever stranded without access to optimal gear—and on the shifting battlefields of the Galactic Civil War, Soldiers of the Rebellion can find themselves cut off and without support in an instant.\n[P]Trailblazers often act as guides to other members of their squads, helping them to avoid the dangers of the wild and the battlefield alike as the group moves to the most advantageous position possible.  A skilled Trailblazer can not only allow a group of PCs to win difficult battles through subterfuge and trickery, but also to avoid unnecessary battles entirely. The Rebel Alliance frequently needs to achieve objectives without the Empire noticing, and so the best battle is often the one that was never fought. A Trailblazer can be a substantial boon to any [B]Age of Rebellion[b] group in other contexts, too whether the PCs are moving through the wilds or the streets of a city.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{"wvxwevpwqufzob60":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kziwzeiod08ctg99":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"jt2vs4w1v9rgoazn":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"n6qrjvn5moawpsw5":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"vnwz6lcasww4bwrl":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"1ynexkre3tg8oljp":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Stalker","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Stalker to all Stealth and Coordination checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"XPx0Mg7hTNo707t1","attributes":{"Coordination":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Stealth":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent2":{"name":"Outdoorsman","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Outdoorsman from checks to move through terrain or manage environmental effects.

{"name":"Shipwright","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Shipwright - Designing For War[h4]\nIn peacetime, a Shipwright designs, oversees, and launches custom ships to grace the hyperspace lanes. During the era of the Republic, Shipwrights crafted ships with elegant fins, spires, and curves that made people wonder, \"Who built that?\" Currently, the Empire favors ship designs that express power and inspire fear. The Core World shipyards have followed suit, as the Empire remains the dominant culture in the galaxy. Elegance is a bygone ideal, a symbol of Republic corruption or a lost fancy. Even the Alliance often must eschew aesthetics for practicality and utility, something many Shipwrights in the Rebellion understand but mourn.\n[P]Shipwrights receive [B]Gunnery, Knowledge (Education), Mechanics,[b] and [B]Piloting (Space)[b] as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]In the Alliance, Shipwrights primarily maintain and repair the various ships it fields. An important secondary task is the breaking down and retrofitting of commissioned starships. Since the majority of these vessels come from smuggled sources, civilian donations, or scrapyard rescues, Shipwrights have to determine if they should be utilized, scrapped, or junked.\n[P]For ships to be added to the Fleet, they then oversee the installation of new or updated equipment and basic repairs. Then comes crew training, space trials and testing, readying the hull for hyperspace travel, and, for some lucky Shipwrights, naming and serving aboard them.\n[P]Alliance shipyards tend to be hidden, remote, or highly mobile-often all three. As always, materials, supplies, and labor are the main factors limiting construction, along with time; at any point, the Empire may suddenly discover the location of the shipyard, prompting a rapid evacuation.\n[P]Shipwrights can work on a space station or in its shipyard. Mobile Alliance shipyards can house weapon platforms or support mining and refining facilities. The more advanced shipyards resemble a fully staffed mining colony. In such a shipyard, Shipwrights must incorporate industrial components in to their designs as well as handle worker accommodations and support. At this level, Shipwrights resemble civil engineers. Even something as basic as organic waste elimination can be important to the Alliance. Only Shipwrights, for example, might know that the station's trash disposal hold can hide an allied light freighter attempting to allude Imperial patrols!\n[P]On the rare occasion when the Alliance requires a new ship design, Shipwrights usually must throw aesthetics out the transparisteel window to aim for utility, safety, and reliability. Primarily, their designs must try to ensure that the ship and its crew can accomplish the mission and hopefully return in one piece. Good Shipwrights keep in mind that their creations should be easy to repair, offer a modicum of comfort, and be able to throw enough firepower at enemies to make crews happy to fly aboard them into victory.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Fully Operational[h4]","attributes":{"ct3btqrzjtc86mw4":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ettbaq78wnvbd62p":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"aq7jfbca6xq9sgm9":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"udcijtxxynpn6r48":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"rhb68o7n01r4a4iz":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"xk1m2nnwi4fgecdt":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Dockyard Expertise","description":"May make an [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Knowledge (Education) check[b] when at a space dock, if successful, the cost and time for repairs is reduced by 25% per rank of Dockyard Expertise.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Fully Operational[h4]","activation":"Active (Action)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveAction","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LfgCdYncUinWhah1","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Eye for Detail","description":"After making a Mechanics or Computers check, may suffer strain up to ranks in Eye for Detail to convert that many [SU] to [AD].[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 34 - Special Modifications[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidental","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"8VyYy5txEJJ4MGwh","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Creative Design","description":"As part of resolving a successful crafting check, the character may also apply a result equivalent to spending a number of [AD] equal to his ranks in Creative Design.

{"name":"Demolitionist","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Demolitionist - Force of Destruction[h4]\nDemolitionists are masters of explosives and Incendiary devices. Often seen as dangerous pyromaniacs, most Demolitionists possess a deep understanding of the physics behind combustion and explosion on an intuitive level as well as an academic one. They are not mindless destroyers, but artists. Demolitionists are adept at wreaking havoc while avoiding being injured by their own handiwork—most of the time.\n\n[P]A Demolitionist's additional career skills are [B]Computers, Cool, Mechanics,[b] and [B]Skulduggery[b]. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. With this selection of skills, Demolitionists can be much more technically-minded than most Hired Guns. They are also suited to much more than straightforward combat. Demolitionists can excel at setting traps, from improvised trip-wires tied to grenades to sophisticated proximity and timed explosives. Whereas another Hired Gun might go after an enemy in a straight-up fight, a Demolitionist may find a more inventive route, such as rigging a thermal detonator to explode when the target starts up his speeder. Some Demolitionists enjoy the thrill of combat as much as any other Hired Gun. However, they favor flame projectors, grenade launchers, and missile tubes—anything that creates a large blast.\n\n[P]The work of a Demolitionist is extremely dangerous, as a single misstep can spell doom for the character (and anyone unfortunate enough to be in the general vicinity). In order to succeed, a Demolitionist must be able to keep a clear head and focus on his work, even as blaster bolts fill the air around him. As such, most Demolitionists are adept at staying cool in the most nerve-wracking situations.\n\n[P]In order to put their skills to the greatest use, Demolitionists must have an understanding of the principles of construction, as well as knowing how to construct their explosive devices. Both of these are where some skill with Mechanics becomes important. By knowing how a machine operates, or the load-bearing points of a structure, a Demolitionist can determine where to place explosives for the greatest effect. Similarly, Demolitionists know how to get the most from their tools, creating larger than expected explosions or causing devastating chain reactions. Demolitionists can use their creative talents for more than sheer destruction, and can usually be counted on to find an inventive route out of a dangerous situation. Of course, sometimes that plan is even more dangerous than the original threat.\n\n[P]For many groups, having a Demolitionist around is both a blessing and a curse. Demolitionists are very effective both in combat and in any job benefiting from sabotage. However, it is far from unheard of for Demolitionists to cause unintended collateral damage when things go really wrong. Fortunately, experienced Demolitionists rarely make mistakes (even if, in their profession, many mistakes tend to be final). Most individuals operating on the fringe understand that theirs is a life of danger, and think that the benefits of partnering with a skilled Demolitionist outweigh the added risk.

{"name":"Skip Tracer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Skip Tracer[h4]\nNot all debts ned to be settled with blasters. Sometimes, a Bounty Hunter just needs to do some legwork, find a target, and get that individual to pay what is owed with a few well-chosen words. This is the specialty of Skip Tracers, who take on commissions to seek out people with unpaid debts from clients who wish to have items returned, cash given back, or recompense paid in some other way. Most Skip Tracers prefer to keep their guns holstered for the whole job, and try their utmost to avoid causing negotiations with their targets to break down explosively. Property destruction and medical bills cut into the commission, after all. Of course, as most Skip Tracers know all too well, things rarely go so smoothly. More often, the Skip Tracer ends up needing to apply pressure somewhere along the line, whether this takes the form of gaining leverage on the target or delivering a threat of violence—at the hands of the client or otherwise.\n[P]In addition to the Bounty Hunter's eight career skills, the Skip Tracer receives [B]Cool[b], [B]Knowledge (Underworld)[b], [B]Negotiation[b], and [B]Skulduggery[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the Skip Tracer may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]All Bounty Hunters have access to investigative abilities through access to Perception and Streetwise as career skills, but Skip Tracers are particularly strong at this aspect of the job. Several Skip Tracer talents are especially useful when backed by a high Cunning or Intelligence; Improved Street Smarts and Reconstruct the Scene let Skip Tracers find leads on even the scantest of evidence, and Bypass Security can help these investigators reach secured locations where their targets might be hiding. Through dedication and keen insight, Skip Tracers can locate and pursue a target across nearly any distance, which makes them ideal for finding people who wish to avoid notice.\n[P]Skip Tracer also benefit from an investment in their Presence, as once they find their marks, they must convince them to part with what is owed. Several of the Skip Tracer's talents, such as Good Cop and Nobody's Fool make it difficult of targets to get the better of Skip Tracers in negotiations, and ensure that they recover the client's property. If matters do become ugly, however, Skip Tracers are not defenseless: Hard-Boiled and Rapid Recovery allow Skip Tracers to doggedly pursue their quarry even after taking a beating, and Soft Spot lets them slip a finishing blow through at exactly the right moment, even against a tough opponent.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 32 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{"869jgkyh20fdwwy1":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"cf91cyjbp7t89ysy":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"s47gp92y648dvv7s":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"fvjczzyfauwxkxib":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"h85e9orj5qbslfyf":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"5vrngt5yruofiwd2":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Bypass Security","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Bypass Security from checks made to disable a security device or open a locked door.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"WI8L0yojUeqEYjfl","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Hard-Boiled","description":"When recovering strain after an encounter, may spend [AD] up to ranks in Hard-Boiled to recover 1 wound per [AD] spent.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 34 - No Disintegrations[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"HBeZLlwGYjvlzNz0","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Good Cop","description":"May spend [AD][AD] from a Charm or Negotiation check to upgrade ability of a single ally's subsequent Social Interaction check against the target a number of times equal to ranks in Good Cop.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Far Horizons[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"l4UexqhGQ8If8Lxu","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Rapid Recovery","description":"When healing strain after an encounter, heal 1 additional strain per rank of Rapid Recovery.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"bQXTPoPl2EToZkJk","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent5":{"name":"Expert Tracker","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Expert Tracker from checks to find tracks or track targets.

If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience.

Their overall motives can be as varied as those of any being, yet they tend to share a common instinct to heal where there is harm. While many will simply take up residence with whatever lord, corporation, or boss will hire them, other Doctors will find a way to get out into the larger galaxy, both to bring help to those in need and to experience life in some fashion.\n\n[P]A Player Character Doctor is likely to be considered a kind of \"combat medic\" for the group; this isn't a bad thing at all, and the role will make him very popular.

{"name":"Strategist","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Strategist - In For The Long Haul[h4]\n\nStrategists are responsible for forming the core directives\nused in the war against the Empire. Rather\nthan focusing on individual battles, they analyze the\nbig picture—both what has happened and what is\nbound to happen should their plans bear fruit. They\nalso monitor the effectiveness of logistics to ensure\nthat military units aren’t too thinly spread or sparsely\nsupplied to be effective. Anything that might change\nthe tide of battle concerns them, and they must possess\nsharp minds and keen\nwits to keep all the variables\nunder control.\n[P]Strategists receive [B]Computers, Cool, Vigilance,[b]\nand [B]Knowledge (Warfare)[b] as additional career\nskills. If this is the character’s starting specialization,\nthe player may choose two of these skills and gain\none free rank in each without spending experience.\nThough they rarely possess direct command of armies\nor units, Strategists are expected to arrange the highlevel\ndetails of the operations and battles the Rebel\nmilitary must participate in. A Strategist must also be\nincredibly detail-oriented, as forgetting a minor item\nwhen planning a planetary strike could lead to the\ndeaths of thousands of Alliance troops.\n[P]Strategists must be able to keep their cool. Viewing\nthe Galactic Civil War from such a lofty vantage\npoint can cause even the most tranquil individuals to\nbreak under pressure. In fact, the conflict at hand is\nso vast and complex that it can be difficult to digest\nit all, even in multiple sittings. Keeping a cool head\nalso allows the Strategist an opportunity to examine\nan enemy’s movements in order to discern whether\nor not it is attempting a feint or a full-fledged assault.\nImperial commanders are cunning tacticians, and\ntheir ruses can be disastrous if they aren’t seen for\nwhat they are before it’s too late.\n[P]Obviously, successful Strategists must know the\nins and outs of warfare. Being aware of their enemies’\ncapabilities, as well as those of their own troops, is\nvital to planning a successful campaign. In addition,\npossessing intimate knowledge of wars both past\nand present allows Strategists to learn from\nthe lessons of their predecessors, or to\ncall up a little-used tactic to catch the\nEmpire off guard.\n[P]Though a Strategist may\nseem like an odd choice for\nthe typical Alliance cell, the\nknowledge and keen insight\nsuch a character brings to a\nparty are well worth having.\nWith a little combat training, a\nStrategist can act as a secondary combatant\nwhile watching the battlefield for\nsigns of opportunity or disaster. Given their\npotential training in both Cool and Vigilance,\nit’s unlikely that a Strategist will be\ncaught unawares when things turn ugly.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 32 - Lead by Example[h4]","attributes":{"ojymsrtujliljsf2":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"xknbhfq2z4qz34md":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"sf13iidw53vfm7g6":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"bwhte6rzmfb4cedx":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"nqipupkftzrbo3sg":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ml427ych74nf68sz":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Researcher","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Researcher from all Knowledge checks.

{"name":"Driver","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Driver - The Need for Speed[h4]\n\n[P]Pilots are great for traveling from one system to another, but it's the Drivers that move beings around once they hit dirtside. While nearly anyone can manage the basics of a ground vehicle or a speeder, a Driver is priceless when the blaster bolts start flying or the weather turns particularly nasty. It's one thing to know how to go forward and back and how to apply the breaks. It's another thing entirely to know how far one can flip a speeder over to one side without stalling while skirting the wall of a canyon, swerving through rocky outcroppings and avoiding a hail of plasma fire from the swoop gang that's chasing the group.\n\n[P]Drivers understand the machines they operate, and they are exceptionally skilled with nearly anything that moves from one place on a planet to another, typically demonstrating some higher level of style or finesse.\n\n[P]In addition to the skills that round out an Explorer, Drivers have access to [B]Cool, Gunnery, Mechanics,[b] and [B]Piloting (Planetary)[b] as their bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience. As always, remember that no starting skill may have higher than two ranks.\n\n[P]Drivers are highly valued almost anywhere they go. Companies, military and security units, governments, and criminal factions all have a regular need for those who can transport personnel and goods over a planet's surface. Additionally, more than a few planets in the Outer Rim have traditions of racing of one style or another, and Drivers are naturals for being able to enter such competitions and walk away with a decent purse. Naturally, this depends on their skill and their ability to avoid being killed by other Drivers.\n\n[P]An Explorer with a Driver specialization is a natural fit for almost any Player Character group. His basic skill set as an Explorer is already helpful, and his talents for moving the group around on a planet automatically make him exceedingly valuable.

{"name":"Racer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Racer - Eyes to the Future[h4]\nRacers race. Whether by landspeeder, airspeeder, starship, or on foot, the Racer speeds forward to be the first, and the fastest. However, the Force grants not only extra sensory insight about the race, but also guides Racers to think about what the race means.\n[P]Racers receive [B]Cool[b], [B]Coordination[b], [B]Piloting (Planetary)[b] and [B]Piloting (Space)[b] as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]For these characters, racing is less about speed and more about knowing their position in time and space. Racers don't ask how to get somewhere, they intuit their arrival at their destinations. In many ways, they  push to understand the future in relation to the positioning of self. The Force, racing forward in time, in its own way, has carved a path that Racers must follow.\n[P]With the Force, physical obstacle aren't obstacles per se. They represent perceptual shadows on the fabric of space time. Racers use the Force to peer into these shadows, seeing not only what exists in the shadow, but also when such interactions exist in the shadow. If they don't exist in the shadow at all, Racers avoid them. They were either never supposed to be there or their life possibly ended before then. If Racers know they don't exist at some point in a  potential future, then they can pick a future in which they do.\n[P]As their skills develop, this perception extends from their own relative position to those of other living beings. Racers become predictive not only about their own place in space-time, but also about other beings' places relative to them. This allows Racers an eerie ability to be at the right place at the right time to intercept an individual. Catching a bounty just before the target escapes or rescuing a person in need at just the right time is an incredible benefit to the community. In the wrong hands, this talent can be terrifying, as dark side Force users employ it to talk their target stalking and harassing with a looming presence at every turn.\n[P]Obviously, Racers must have a calm demeanor and steady hands, even if the adrenaline rush and excitement of a race would shake the steeliest nerves. Anger can push them to excessive aggression, and fear can lead to hesitation at the wrong moment. Mistakes cost lives, not just for Racers' lives but also those of other pilots, audience members, pit crew and innocent bystanders. Many Racers claim to attain a paradoxical stillness in the middle of a race, achieving a transcendental oneness with vehicle, speed, and self. At this point, the Force flows naturally through them. However, ordinary, practiced skill in piloting a starship or speeder is a must, even Racers can't rely on the Force alone.\n[P]Podracing is the first obvious practical application for this specialization. The Racer specialization also can be useful with everything from racing on foot to racing starships. For  Racers, notions of time, space and position become almost meaningless. Racers can be twelve parsecs away from a target but close to interception with a fast hyperdrive, while those on foot may be only a yard away but separated by a high, impassable durasteel wall. Which one of these Racers is closer to the goal?[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Endless Vigil[h4]","attributes":{"jdqg0jq9bgp1bj7v":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"u4tjs4m5k98dbhll":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"mlaguaw79de46xke":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"1lwpl77q68n6ojc1":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"pk7pezqh86k5v7zh":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"l5lqnz0qavtgywvj":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ygnhpvk77poo1fas":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"9tjg05ozx4ddbb0k":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Skilled Jockey","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Skilled Jockey from all Piloting (Planetary) and Piloting (Space) checks the character attempts.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"SVKVcOJTxNsFu8Qf","attributes":{"Piloting: Planetary":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Piloting: Space":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Conditioned","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Conditioned from Athletics and Coordination checks.

Infiltrators endeavor to place themselves in the very den of the beast, usually sneaking or lying their way in undetected. All too often, Infiltrators face the worst possible odds without the benefit of direct backup, and frequently without a way out if they are discovered by the wrong people at the wrong time.\n\n[P]Infiltrators gain [B]Deception, Melee, Skulduggery,[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] as their additional career skills; taking this as the first specialization for a PC grants a free rank in two of these skills. Masters of covert work, Infiltrators know how to con or lie their way past almost anyone, and they know all of the tricks necessary to break into and out of secure locations, as well as everything else needed for underhanded operations. They tend to prefer silent and deadly attacks, often best accomplished with hand-to-hand weapons.\n\n[P]An Infiltrator rarely relies upon brute force or direct confrontation to accomplish his goals. Instead, he uses stealth, guile, subterfuge, and disguise to integrate himself among his enemies. He gains access to sensitive areas, talks to the right people, and employs every other available tactic to obtain valuable information, steal important secrets and assets, and leave behind a target who is reeling from his efforts.\n\n[P]Lately, Infiltrators are used by the Alliance as part of special strike teams sent throughout Imperial-controlled space, where they are used in combined operations intended to disrupt the Empire's plans while gathering information at the same time. For more direct combat missions, Infiltrators tend to operate in a support role. When the mission calls for subterfuge and more covert operations, Infiltrators are often the ones in charge.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 97 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"4cpeiavee8imc7uy":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"k5epd1dgdgr80na6":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"mx3t2c8x6okar7yg":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"n0su719aeopamtoa":{"mod":"Melee","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"obg84hv4knhu6p7z":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"jtas4gxqc7lbrd8k":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"77ocylomypupwvxz":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"a9tt512bzsbp6yue":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Dodge","description":"When targeted by combat check, may perform a Dodge incidental to suffer a number of strain no greater than ranks of Dodge, then upgrade the difficulty of the check by that number.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"FSa96HINb4Qqslfp","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Frenzied Attack","description":"When making a Melee or Brawl check, suffer a number of strain to upgrade the attack an equal number of times.

A blaster that works beyond factory tolerances? No problem. A transponder that identifies a smuggler's freighter as a religious pilgrimage craft? It'll cost a few credits, but sure. A protocol droid altered to carry out an assassination? Just how big is that credit line, anyway?\n\n[P]The Outlaw Tech adds the following to his available career skills: [B]Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Underworld), Mechanics,[b] and [B]Streetwise[b]. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. This gives him the opportunity to have two starting ranks in Mechanics, if he also chooses that as one of his free starting career skill ranks. With his talents, the Outlaw Tech is adept at doing fantastic things with technology that he probably shouldn't. He's also tough, clever, and adaptable.\n\n[P]Outlaw Techs find the Outer Rim very comfortable. They're able to practice their unique style of work with far less chance of running afoul of Imperial agents or other repressive government restrictions. They also find it far easier to make the contacts and get the kinds of customers that really appreciate their services. Of course, it's a lot harder to get true state-of-the-art equipment, but making do with what's on hand is a specialty of the Outlaw Tech.\n\n[P]Outlaw Techs in a Player Character group will be highly prized, especially for their ability to make all kinds of improvements on other characters' gear. They are also adept at keeping ships and vehicles operational, and in some situations, they're as handy at acquiring certain goods as some Explorers. Without a Smuggler in the group, an Outlaw Tech may be the best bet for dealing with the local black markets.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 90 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"ep8xjkxsjx743ngs":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"r0jdbtpixuj3in92":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"k95g2tf93h8aqw53":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"cq79vel37d50vp1f":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Tinkerer","description":"May add 1 additional hard point to a number of items equal to ranks in Tinkerer.

{"name":"Marshal","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Marshal - The Burden of Peace[h4]\n\n[P]Criminals might run and criminals might hide, but the Marshal won't rest until he drags them back to town in binders. The presence of a strong Marshal is often the only thing keeping a colony from plunging into chaos. The Marshal has a gift for extracting information from witnesses and confessions from criminals. and separating lies and irrelevant information from the truth. Should suspects turn violent, the Marshal is equally adept at talking criminals into a pair of binders or blasting them into oblivion.\n\n[P]Marshals receive [B]Coercion, Knowledge (Underworld), Ranged (Light)[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he gains one free rank in each of two of these skills of his choice, without spending experience. Where most Colonists are forced to rely on talking their way out of trouble, the Marshal finds that his blaster speaks almost as well as he does. Most law officers know that holding the weight of the law over a potential witness is the quickest way to modify his attitude. Marshals can throw the weight of their authority around to get answers. There is little government oversight on the fringe, and often a Marshal's word is the law.\n\n[P]Equally as important is the Marshal's knowledge of crime and criminal elements, especially those operating within his jurisdiction. A Marshal who doesn't take the time to familiarize himself with the local malcontents isn't going to be very good at his job. And when it comes time to go toe to toe with those criminals, the Marshal is ready. Most Marshals know how to use the blasters at their hips.\n\nThe Marshal makes for a great leader in combat-oriented groups, or can provide some muscle to non-combat groups while still participating in social and investigative encounters. Marshals strike a great balance between social skills and combat, allowing them to speak on behalf of combat-oriented parties without being a liability when blaster bolts start flying. Their ability to sort fact from fiction makes them difficult to manipulate, and their gritty determination can carry an entire group that would have otherwise given up hope of success.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Far Horizons[h4]","attributes":{"k7pnmhphe4b5lxhl":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"uf5u47rsgfr07zhg":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"c3gzur4htm8sz3w9":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"97587pmuxiqt0j6v":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"j4db0l2cuqcj2175":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"foeg368pc24iumg1":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Hard Headed","description":"When staggered or disoriented, perform the Hard Headed action; make a  [B]Daunting ([DI][DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to remove status.

{"name":"Steel Hand Adept","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Steel Hand Adept - Unarmed and Dangerous[h4]\n\nThe Jedi were known for, and even symbolized by, their distinctive use of lightsabers. For those who also know of the Sith and their own use of lightsabers, it would seem that these weapons are a universal feature of Force users. This was never truly the case, especially not in this age of the Empire, when most Force sensitives must do without formal training in any Force tradition. Through necessity or choice, Force users do battle with a variety of weapons, from vibro-axes to repeating blasters. And some fight with no weapons at all.\n[P]Steel Hand Adepts gain [B]Brawl, Coordination, Discipline,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the player chooses two of these skills and gains one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These skills allow Adepts to fight with, their mind and body in perfect harmony, and with mastery over both.\n[P]Countless martial arts disciplines have focused on unarmed combat through the millennia, from Ter&auml;s K&auml;si to Zavat.\n[P]Even the most renowned masters of hand-to-hand combat face certain limitations when compared to wielders of the variety of advanced weapons in use throughout the galaxy. No fist or claw can breach heavy armor, or overcome the range advantage of a blaster-none, that is, except those of beings who wield the Force like a weapon.\n[P]As [B]Force and Destiny[b] characters, Steel Hand Adepts might represent Force users with training in a variety of martial arts forms. Some might specialize in a particular form, while others might blend techniques from many practices. Alternatively, an Adept could be self-taught, augmenting an improvisational combat style honed through years of cantina brawls with an instinctive use of the Force. Regardless of their background, Steel Hand Adepts draw on the Force to accomplish seemingly impossible maneuvers, from punching through heavy combat armor to striking enemies beyond arms' reach.\n[P]The ways of Steel Hand Adepts have little basis in the teachings of the Jedi Order. Although the Jedi trained in some hand-to-hand techniques, these were generally used as a recourse should a Knight be disarmed or ambushed without a lightsaber at hand. However, many other Force disciplines have come and gone throughout the galaxy's history, and some of these have focused more prominently on unarmed combat. Conversely, many martial arts traditions have a strong mystical component. tapping into the Force in varying capacities. Although martial arts schools of this kind generally accept members who are not particularly Force-sensitive, those who are so gifted tend to excel, becoming masters and legends.\n[P]The capabilities of Steel Hand Adepts can be astounding for onlookers and terrifying for foes. Not only can adepts exhibit the same range of abilities other Force users draw upon to augment their lightsaber strikes, but they can fight just as effectively without a weapon of any kind. A practiced Adept can even be a match for an accomplished lightsaber duelist. Against more ordinary combatants. they spin and leap with frightening grace, laying foes low with rapid strikes.\n[P]A Steel Hand Adept can easily disarm all but the most skilled opponents through a variety of techniques. Some adepts can even shatter weapons with their bare hands. An unarmed opponent of an Adept, far from being on equal rooting, is almost certainly at an insurmountable disadvantage. Enemies with the seeming advantage of range are not safe, either. Blaster-wielding foes are often surprised when a Force user affects objects and even sentients at a distance, but no Force ability is as shocking as Adepts' ability to lash out with punishing strikes, laying into foes at range with the full strength and impact of their fists and feet.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{"5qarampwzg95klk8":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ll94g8u2ctcsa2am":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"olmcxph2chwyz2qt":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"6jk2sye1jxquoail":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"39nvdam84tdna43z":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ub4wmgnu0uregptd":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"3o96us9d47tgrxed":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kjxfdgvu60nbrac9":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Iron Body","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Iron Body from Coordination and Resilience checks.

With practically the entire galaxy wired to computerized systems, Slicers are extremely valuable people to know, and dangerous to cross.\n\n[P]Slicers naturally tend towards the underworld, yet they are also highly intelligent and knowledgeable. They add these skills to their career skills: [B]Computers, Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Underworld),[b] and [B]Stealth[b]. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Their talents mainly focus on making computerized and electronic systems dance to their tune.\n\n[P]Slicers are among the most valued professionals in the Outer Rim, especially to the criminal world. A Slicer's worth, however, is only as good as his reputation; success and loyalty will earn him top credits, while blowing key operations or double-crossing an employer will tend to make his prospects far less attractive.\n\n[P]A Player Character group without a Slicer will have something of a handicap, especially where acquiring data or handling computerized problems is concerned. A Slicer might join a group for a chance to get away from a bad deal, or simply because he's ready to see the next planet. Slicers tend to be a quirky bunch, so there might be any number of motivations at work.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 91 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 99 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"urua9upwlrg2bc7e":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"nwz1zgzimnrzjcfz":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"6z9gy88snps8q5xk":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"buwc2x3s6ea4qabz":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Codebreaker","description":"Remove [SE] per rank in Codebreaker from checks to break codes or decrypt communications.

{"name":"Operator","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Operator[h4]\nTo catch a target, a Bounty Hunter must be fast, and even the swiftest sentient being cannot hope to outrace a speeder or starship on foot. An Operator prefers to undertake all pursuits from within a vehicle or spacecraft, keeping the target in sight with deft maneuvering and on the run with withering firepower. In a high-speed chase, few characters can match an Operator's expertise, and fewer still are prepared for the arsenal of daring moves and dirty tricks she can unleash.\n[P]In addition to the Bounty Hunter's eight career skills, the operator receives [B]Astrogation[b], [B]Gunnery[b], [B]PIloting (Planetary)[b], and [B]Piloting (Space)[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the Operator may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]A high Agility rating always benefits an Operator, especially when paired with a solid investment in Gunnery and Piloting (Planetary) or Piloting (Space), depending on the Operator's preferred vehicle. An Operator also benefits from an investment in Intellect, as this characteristic is used for both the Astrogation skill—critical in tracking quarry across the galaxy—and for the Mechanics skill.\n[P]Even if the Operator is not the groups's technical expert, having a strong Intellect and a rank or two of Mechanics means that the Operator can make repairs on the fly. After all, most Operators put their craft through its paces (and even push beyond its limits from time to time). Knowing how to fix an overtaxed engine can be the difference between staying on the trail and drifting for weeks, waiting  for a repair team to arrive. Any Bounty Hunter who has spent time adrift in space knows full well the value of being able to perform one's own repairs.\n[P]Operators are sometimes lone wolves, chasing their targets across the gulfs between the stars with no company but a trusty ship. However, many Operators are part of teams of bounty hunters, conveying their comrades on to the location of their foes and running starship interference while they capture targets on the ground. Some such Operators are loathe to leave their ships entirely, though disembarking from time to time is usually unavoidable on the hunt.\n[P]Unlike many other specializations focused on piloting, Operators need to disable enemy ships rather than just destroy them. The Operator specialization gives a character access to numerous talents that help bring targets to a halt, including Debilitating Shot, Hindering Shot, Overwhelm Defenses, and Offensive Driving. All of these abilities are useful for taking down fleeing starships—or, in a pinch, disabling the vessels of rival bounty hunters pursuing the same quarry.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{"ocsk7vnc76i8lc8n":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ho13hm8a8xk4wslw":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"iafktm6vft8hm5yj":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"8fu32sx2s54df5lg":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"9b7mex71trvtkyq9":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"mpa81q9bukc2x4cp":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"36rcxabmfq3i2p0a":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"dzkio9rj9mnud0js":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Galaxy Mapper","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Galaxy Mapper from Astrogation checks.

The galaxy is impossibly old, and nigh-infinite millennia have witnessed the rise and fall of countless civilizations. The Archaeologist endeavors to find these lost cultures and unlock the secrets of their history, art, science, and everything else about them.\n\n[P]Though Archaeologists have a strong focus on their scholastic pursuits and understanding of history, they tend to have a rough-and-tumble approach to dealing with the, inevitable challenges they are likely to face in the field.\n\n[P]An Archaeologist's list of bonus career skills is a clear indication of his particular areas of focus: [B]Athletics, Discipline, Knowledge (Education),[b] and [B]Knowledge (Lore)[b]. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending additional starting experience.\n\n[P]Most Archaeologists believe very passionately that what they do is noble and important to the people of the galaxy. They tend to be less concerned with who is currently in charge, except for how the prevailing policies of the current government impact their studies and digs. Unfortunately for the current state of the field, the Empire tends to take a very heavy hand in matters of \"revisionist history,\" preferring to alter findings to best fit its agendas. As such, most Archaeologists either work outside of Imperial channels or wish they did.\n\n[P]Player Character Archaeologists can easily be the centerpiece of a new campaign, building a team of other specialists to help in a recently embarked-upon expedition. Otherwise, such a character may be between digs and looking either for an expedition to,join or \"filler work\" until he can make the right kinds of contacts.\n\n[P]Perhaps an archeology-oriented Explorer joins a group that's journeying to an area for completely different reasons; he trades his skills and knowledge for the chance to investigate rumors of a potentially valuable find once he gets to where they are going.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 25 - Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{"s07noxcjh8entngo":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"12lbjk88ogmit2b3":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"zc3y49889xxoszd1":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"m1s4ecv8i09r0dop":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Well Rounded","description":"Choose any 2 skills.

{"name":"Beast Rider","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Beast Rider - Mounted Marauders[h4]\n\nMany worlds in the galaxy are too backward, too poor, or have environments too extreme to support modern vehicles. Sometimes, instead of spending credits to adapt a speeder to the cold or create a filter that can keep sand out of a repulsordrive, it is simply easier to use a native mount that has evolved and adapted to local conditions for untold millennia.\n\n[P]While most any being can ride a trained mount, it is the Beast Rider who can break in wild mounts and train them. Once he has trained a mount, the skilled Beast Rider can coax his mount to perform incredible feats, even in the heat of battle. The Beast Rider is also something of an outdoorsman, and is. a valuable member of a team with or without his creature companion.\n\n[P]Beast Riders might be expert riders on a single type of mount or experienced creature wranglers who have spent time with all manner of riding creatures. Most cultures and militaries, despite the broader reliance on modern machinery, still rely heavily on mounts. The Imperials ride lizard-like dewbacks on desert worlds like Tatooine, while the Rebels famously saddled up tauntauns on Hoth. Indigenous cultures throughout the galaxy depend on Beast Riders, including the bantha-obsessed Tusken Raiders of Tatooine and the ruping riders of Onderon.\n\n[P]Beast Riders receive [B]Athletics, Knowledge (Xenology), Perception,[b] and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he gains one free rank in each of two of these skills of his choice, without spending experience. Unlike their fellow Aces, the Beast Rider is at home outdoors, where he can feel the wind on his face. He fits in just as well with the soldiers and scouts of the Rebel Army as with his fellow Aces in starfighters and speeders.\n\n[P]The Rebellion often assigns Beast Riders as scouts at Rebel bases and outposts, conducting patrols and setting up advance defenses and other contingency measures to prepare for potential Imperial discovery. When an Imperial or one of his allies spots creature tracks, he might think it belongs to a wild creature—whereas, if he sees vehicle tracks, he is very likely to investigate. In battle, mounted cavalry might not be quite as fast, agile, or heavily armed and armored as its mechanized counterparts, but it has several advantages. Creature mounts have better camouflage, more mobility in close quarters, and in battle, Imperial vehicles often ignore them outright.\n\n[P]Most groups can benefit from a Beast Rider in their ranks. The Beast Rider is second only to the Spy carer's Scout specialization in matters of wilderness survival and guerrilla warfare. His ability to traverse difficult terrain, capture and train indigenous mounts, and locate food and shelter are critical to a number of Rebel mission profiles. Further, should a team member crash land, or otherwise become stranded, a Beast Rider might be critical to their very survival.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{"3yxgas1qpwd78vvk":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"t5ge7042iehn3j55":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"jldugeyo4ogajofz":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"3s2w37se9ulslrtd":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"1xx6dmhn7oqf9p71":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"yh6k4g78xkmdaclt":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Forager","description":"Remove up to [SE][SE] from skill checks to find food, water, or shelter.

{"name":"Cyber Tech","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Cyber Tech - Self-Improvement At Any Cost [h4]\nMany people think of the body as a machine. After all, it can fulfill complex functions, must be maintained, and wears down over time. When pieces of the body fail or need to be repaired, cyberneticists can help restore function and improve the quality of patients' lives. While Cyber Techs focus their craft entirely on replacing the lost or damaged body parts of  patients, others seen no reason not to upgrade and modify bodies as they would other tools.\n[P]The Cyber Tech specialization gives a Technician a way to explore the realm of medicine, using technical and biological know how to craft and maintain cybernetics, as well as to integrate them into living bodies. Given this ability to skillfully alter their bodies with cybernetics, most Cyber Techs perform at lease some upgrades on themselves. The degree and subtlety of an individual's Cyber Tech's upgrades tend to depend on the individual's culture, species and personal beliefs. Within some cultures, extensive cybernetic augmentation is considered unusual or even taboo.\n[P]In addition to the Technician's eight career skills, the Cyber Tech receives [B]Athletics, Cybernetics, Mechanics, Medicine[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the  character's starting specialization, the Cyber Tech may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Despite the advantages of cybernetics, which many Cyber Tech are quick to point out, most humans and members of many other species tend not to seek out substantial enhancement unless absolutely necessary. Replacing a lost limb with a cybernetic one is common sense, but for most, the prospect of lopping off a healthy limb to replace it with a stronger one is another matter entirely. Still, among most sentient species with the necessary technology, there are those who have reasons for wanting to surpass flesh.\n[P]Other groups and individuals hold no such qualms about removing flesh, bones and organs to replace them with what Cyber Techs see as undoubtedly superior components. Ganks, for instance, are a species known for their heavy use of cybernetic augmentation: completely unmodified Gank are very rare. Droids, of course have a special relationship with artificial limbs, and most droids desire periodic part replacements for maintenance.\n[P]A Cyber Tech can take on extra cybernetics and can improve augmentations far beyond their normal capacities. Further, a Cyber Tech can assist comrades with medical care and by replacing body parts with cybernetics, though most beings only accept this help after losing a body part - no matter how fervently the Cyber Tech speaks to the virtues of replacing squishy unreliable flesh and organs with cold, sturdy steel.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{"ohab3et7cyl24c3m":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"75cikuy03g4xu6gd":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"mlva6z7vi18v3hwv":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"hw575zokfzpztxqe":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"9we93yiaxnq84jrx":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"6gmy47qz3xnr4199":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"0xwbxm93osegta60":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"vr9q2yq36xrev08f":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Cyberneticist","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Cyberneticist from checks to build, repair, and install cybernetic implants .

{"name":"Charmer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Charmer -  The Smooth Operator[h4]\n\n[P]Confident and elegant, the Charmer employs his wits and wiles with more precision than a laser scalpel. Rather than resorting to uncivilized intimidation tactics or distasteful acts of violence, the Charmer believes the best way to get what he wants is to simply ask for it. A Charmer knows how to talk the talk, possessing natural charisma that makes him irresistible. Struck by the flash of his smile or the wink of his eye, people have a hard time denying anything to the Charmer.\n\n[P]The Charmer combines the silver tongue of a Politico, the street smarts of a Scoundrel, and the keen mind of a Trader. Where the Politico might rally, chastise. or even bribe to achieve his objective, the Charmer showers his mark with flattery. While the Trader relies on his ability to haggle down a price, the Charmer convinces others that lowering the price is their idea. When a Scoundrel resorts to coercion and violence, a Charmer applies a softer touch to disarm his opponents with words alone.\n\n[P]In addition to the Smuggler's eight career skills, the Charmer also receives [B]Charm, Cool, Leadership,[b] and [B]Negotiation[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n\n[P]The chief weapon in a Charmer's arsenal is clearly his undeniable charisma. When coaxing his way into a private club or restricted area, the Charmer knows how to compliment without sounding sycophantic. In rare cases when his debonair appearance and refined taste fails him, the Charmer knows how to resort to negotiation and trickery to get his way, doing so with his own smooth brand of flair and style. The Charmer keeps a cool head in the hottest situations, which often serves as inspiration to others, and he has no qualms with taking a leadership role if it furthers his purposes. Whether or not he knows the right thing to say, the Charmer always knows how to say it.\n\n[P]Despite all his silvered words, the Charmer is no gilded flower. When all else fails, if the Charmer cannot diffuse the situation before it escalates, or cannot convince others to fight in his place, the Charmer holds his own in combat. In a fight, the Charmer can cause opponents to doubt their motives and lower their guard. The Charmer's Smuggler career gives him the knowledge to navigate the underworld, the ability to escape a jail cell, and the skill to steal a starship for a quick getaway.\n\n[P]A Smuggler who chooses Charmer as his specialization is an exceptional choice for nearly any campaign. His emphasis on social interaction makes the Charmer handy in any intrigue-oriented campaign, but his Smuggler fundamentals and ability to negotiate with merchants, distract would-be attackers, or diffuse combat encounters make him a welcome addition to underworld- or combat-focused campaigns as well.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Fly Casual[h4]","attributes":{"b1ycgr6s0iiaamu7":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"9htpb41tklqzij15":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"y6nn3ixe1wz1mmi0":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"svhj7bt0ryqjljig":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4k9367l88650pkui":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"rozcw5tkgaog44zq":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"kjh8y23z11rg42x1":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"dhsf8pjem1bcx1fa":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Smooth Talker","description":"When first acquired choose 1 skill; Charm, Coercion, Deception, or Negotiation.

{"name":"Recruit","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Recruit[h4]\n\nDue to [B]Age of Rebellion's[b] focus on the Galactic Civil War, most groups of PCs find themselves embroiled in conflict very quickly. Against a force like the Empire, any form of military training can mean the difference between life and death. While the Alliance isn't as organized or regimented as the Empire, they do try to give a decent number of their members some form of combat training. This training helps to enhance the Rebels' chance not only to survive in combat but to fight effectively to achieve their goals.\n\n[P]The Recruit specialization is a universal specialization, and the experience cost to take it is ten times the total number of specializations that the character would have after adding the new specialization. While this means that the specialization costs the same as a career specialization, note that universal specializations are not career specializations.\n\n[P]The additional career skills a PC receives when taking this specialization are [B]Athletics, Discipline, Survival,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b]. Alliance operatives who go through this training enhance their physical fitness, awareness, and general competency at a wide variety of skills. Those who commit extra time and effort can also enhance their abilities with weapons and ground vehicles, as well as their general knowledge of the many worlds to which they may end up traveling.\n\n[P]Characters from almost any career can benefit from becoming a Recruit and gaining some basic military training. Small teams of specialists going up against the Empire's best will likely need to call upon every scrap of combat ability they collectively possess to survive dramatic fights for their very lives.\n\n[P]The Alliance strongly recommends such training for any Rebels who are actively going into the field, regardless of their career, goals, or role in a team. Even Diplomats are actively encouraged to undergo military training; they do no good to anyone if they cannot come back alive from their latest efforts to negotiate a treaty or acquire supplies. Becoming a Recruit might not make a character a full-fledged special forces hero, but it certainly doesn't hurt.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 100 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"i9f1oqrwz8pju78k":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"uvj95dobt330rrw2":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"o6x3iwaz32i9sx69":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"3ygk9ysaazhhtgg7":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"o4a1cezjnchpqamv":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"xmbpyftn7kiyvau8":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"z63r2svlzof7va41":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ns7cscfqaktjob60":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Basic Combat Training","description":"Brawl and Ranged (Light) become career skills.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"F5RqsEbgpKXUopnX","attributes":{"tzdto0p8sl4jrxm3":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"k3b3krktz4mf6qbr":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true}}},"talent1":{"name":"Second Wind","description":"Once per encounter, may use Second Wind incidental to heal strain equal to ranks in Second Wind.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"Jxe5ukackg1UcAgT","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Outdoorsman","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Outdoorsman from checks to move through terrain or manage environmental effects.

{"name":"Prophet","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Prophet - A Cantor for a Choir[h4]\nThe Jedi Order's proselytizing ebbed and flowed, much as the Force did throughout the Old Republic. Understanding of the Force couldn't be pressured upon a student without causing resentment and anger, which promises a fall toward the dark side. So for Prophets, they proselytized not to convert, but to offer a voice of hope and an opportunity to learn about the power of the Force.\n[P]Now, with the Jedi Order destroyed and the Galactic Republic shattered, Prophets carry a fervor not seen before in the history of the galaxy. To them, their knowledge of the light side of the Force reflects the struggle against the dark. If the Galactic Empire is the shadow blotting out the stars, then Prophets are single points of light, hoping to ignite a candle here and there to light up the sky.\n[P]Prophets gain the following additional career skills: [B]Charm, Coercion, Deception,[b] and [B]Leadership[b]. Characters who start with this specialization first get one rank in two of these skills without spending experience.\n[P]Like Advisors, this specialization directly interacts with people, granting them insight and counsel when needed. Unlike Advisors, Prophets address the crowd, not the individual. Their message has to reach as many ears as possible, in the hope that their ideas or warnings catch fire. Prophets influence communities, cities, or even planets if given a medium and a message.\n[P]The medium comes in a variety of forms: a sermon on a soapbox or an altar, a HoloNet posting or recording, flyers or tracts passed from hand to claw, or even images on a poster, painting, or pirate transmission. It doesn't matter what medium, only the passion and truth of the message.\n[P]The message might be filtered through a religious lens, but not always. Prophets are keyed into the Cosmic Force more keenly, and images of the future provide wisdom, guidance, and, for followers, an identity. Since Prophets are only mortal, they can only try to interpret with mortal concepts and metaphors. They then have to translate that message into simple language, further diluting the content. The next person's limited understanding then further alters that message. The real question is whether this constant alteration by verbal or visual transmission distorts the message or enhances it just as the Force intended.\n[P]Prophets who use their abilities for evil or selfish ends have an easier time now during the Galactic Civil War. Those suffering from the Empire's rule want a voice of hope to give them a reason to live on, and as long as the message doesn't violate Imperial restrictions on religion or political sedition, Prophets can enjoy a safe (and profitable) career. Even on planets free from the Empire, other sources of oppression (slavery, Hutt influence, corporate interests, and the like) may drive people to a religious charlatan, especially one who can produce miracles.\n[P]Even well-meaning Prophets should be wary, since it is much too easy for them to insert their own desires, needs, or fears into their visions, distorting them into their own ends, manipulating their followers into believing their own egos.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Unlimited Power[h4]","attributes":{"a4ro673k4hthuiq0":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"qmi16dk8saohsh5c":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"kg4zargq69sgwqkg":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"5579tbuni3hclwwf":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"v4l3x1zv4jjtvpvo":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"n1ka4ocw38yf6415":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"6gy2sruvpgjrr7se":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ab06fo03vcu1p47u":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Overwhelming Aura","description":"Commit [FO].

However, a small subset of these enforcers focused their attentions on a far greater and more dangerous threat. They trained tirelessly to find and eliminate those who had fallen to the dark side of the Force and willingly embraced corruption These Sentinels were called Shadows, and they hunted the Sith.\n\n[P]For many years, the Sith were thought destroyed, and the Jedi Shadows gave up their calling or pursued other dark side Force users. They never realized that the Sith had not been eliminated, and were hiding right under their noses.\n\n[P]Now, with the Jedi Order destroyed and a Dark Lord of the Sith ruling the Galactic Empire, those who would follow the path of the Shadow find their roles reversed. No longer the secret investigators of an established order who searched the shadows of civilization, they are now the ones who must stay hidden. However, within these dark corners. Shadows still work tirelessly to bring justice to untouchable criminals and dark side Force users alike.\n\n[P]Shadows acquire [B]Knowledge (Underworld), Skulduggery, Stealth,[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These characters recognize that stealth and deception are integral to finding the targets they hunt. Criminal organizations are often mired in secrecy. and uncovering these secrets requires underhanded methods. While their techniques are frequently of questionable moral character. Shadows firmly believe their ultimate accomplishments more than justify the tools that they must use.\n\n[P]Of course, an initiate who has turned to the dark side can prove a powerful opponent for a Shadow. Working against such an adversary can require all of an adept's mundane and Force talents. A Shadow's willingness to examine and utilize every tool and asset can play a major factor in overcoming such capable foes.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 94 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"7czxmsjtzk8mqsi8":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"zthkyrhhgtsdqs8a":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"1pz08e7clybaxa4a":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"goqzqlxcxqr5z6vd":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"gc3av0nf9aihzvu2":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ovqv30oi9ffuzb9w":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Sleight of Mind","description":"Add [BO] to all Stealth checks unless the opposition is immune to Force powers.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 156 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 152 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"nni1ghEkbwYnJ7fg","attributes":{"Stealth":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent1":{},"talent2":{"name":"Codebreaker","description":"Remove [SE] per rank in Codebreaker from checks to break codes or decrypt communications.

{"name":"Droid Tech","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Droid Tech - Creating Sentience[h4]\nDroids are prevalent across the galaxy, from the shining spheres of the Core to the dingy backwater worlds far from the center's light. To most inhabitants of the galaxy, droids are little more than particularly complex tools. However, some organic sentients find a kinship with these mechanical beings, seeing a spark of life in them beyond their shells and circuitry. Whether or not they treat the droids around them as mere objects or as sentient beings. Droid Techs possess an unparalleled skill at inventing, repairing and dealing with droids.\n[P]Technicians who become Droid Techs gain access to a wealth of abilities that make them better at creating, repairing and directing droids. On the edges of society, droids often constitute much of the labor force due to their low cost - and for the same reason, these droids are often poorly maintained. A Droid Tech can keep droids functional and organized better than anyone else, whether this means meticulously performing upgrades and customizations on a trusted droid partner or keeping a team of pit droids working at maximum efficiency. Far from official factories and even from well-stocked garages where replacement parts can be found, a Droid Tech can be incredibly valuable.\n[P]Droid Techs receive [B]Computers, Cool, Mechanics[b] and [B] Leadership[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the Droid Tech may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Some Droid Techs are not satisfied to merely maintain mechanical beings, but actually want to create new, unique droids with unprecedented abilities and features. Custom-built droids are not as common as standard models, but they are not especially rare, either. The most skilled Droid Techs can bring extremely complex creations to life, building droids that perform a single task with mechanical precision or versatile models capable of handling any situation the galaxy throws at them. The deep philosophical and ethical ramifications of creating sentient being for a purpose weigh heavily on the minds of a few, of course, but most citizens of the galaxy do not dwell too long on such matters.\n[P]In addition to having abilities that facilitate building and repairing droids, Droid Techs are gifted with a knack for convincing droids to actually do things for them. While some droids are well mannered and helpful, others can be ill-tempered, capricious, or even downright cruel - but also too useful to dispense with entirely. Getting difficult droids to work toward the group's common good can be quite a task, but a skilled Droid Tech is better equipped for this task than anyone else. To this end, in addition to benefiting from a high Intellect, Droid Techs might  also find a high Presence characteristic and ranks in the Leadership skill useful. These have the added benefit of making it easier to deal with organic beings - though some Droid Techs prefer to avoid dealing with organics entirely.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{"8nhr8n3uselhhjob":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"doqh9r62p6juldua":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"a9fbscwj7tjc364g":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"jc8g0see5mld576l":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"wk7fordre2xgfofb":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"zsp84dt2e7e168ii":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"yog0ddb15rjdzqp5":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"mfvn9x24yoo6budh":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Machine Mender","description":"When making a Mechanics check to help a character heal wounds, the target heals 1 additional wound per rank of Machine Mender.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 34 - Special Modifications[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"Ris01ssv48CZfECa","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Hidden Storage","description":"Gain hidden storage in vehicles or equipment that holds items with total encumbrance equal to ranks in Hidden Storage.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"v7zezMtKJf52jxC0","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Speaks Binary","description":"When directing NPC droids, may grant them [BO] per rank of Speaks Binary on checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"wlbuCsu3awJClhVB","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent4":{"name":"Deft Maker","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Deft Maker from checks to repair, modify, construct, or program droids.

He can make a plodding old transport run far above its performance ratings, and given time and some modifications, he can turn it into one of the fleetest and most maneuverable craft ever to take to the stars.\n\n[P]A Pilot is naturally focused on mastering his craft, and his additional career skills show it: [B]Astrogation, Gunnery, Piloting (Planetary),[b] and [B]Piloting (Space)[b]. If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. A Pilot's talents further reinforce his dominance in the cockpit.\n\n[P]Pilot is another specialization that rarely leads to unemployment. If a Pilot doesn't already have his own ship (and the inevitable Obligation that goes with it), he will likely be able to sign on with any number of groups, criminal or otherwise. Once he establishes his competency at the controls, he'll be able to get some fairly choice assignments. A Player Character Pilot will be considered indispensable to his group, especially after the first space battle or ship-related crisis.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 83 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 69 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"y0aio4uklvwjl98t":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"x2omus969h5296n0":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"egllwpx5ywwznkvz":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ic4tctci24kd8lfv":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ipchpxc2e5ubchgn":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"egxu439eyoukjuka":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"x5p12yyjfwa9f0fb":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"nykngek8zfnnd3mb":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Full Throttle","description":"Take a Full Throttle action; make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Piloting check[b] to increase a vehicle's top speed by 1 for a number of rounds equal to Cunning.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"hh53wWnCZSyBZtnP","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Skilled Jockey","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Skilled Jockey from all Piloting (Planetary) and Piloting (Space) checks the character attempts.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"SVKVcOJTxNsFu8Qf","attributes":{"Piloting: Planetary":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Piloting: Space":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Galaxy Mapper","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Galaxy Mapper from Astrogation checks.

{"name":"Courier","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4] Courier – Ensuring Delivery[h4]\nThere is more to military intelligence than stealing the enemy's secrets. That data must be secured and delivered to the specialists who can best exploit it. The Courier specializes in transporting critical information, often while working incognito far behind enemy lines. These experts take the necessary risks of repeatedly crossing through security checkpoints or even active battlefronts. They must be capable of operating under foes' scrutiny without drawing undue attention. To a certain extent, these Spies are a very specialized type of smuggler, dealing primarily in information rather than physical goods. Not surprisingly, many Couriers developed underworld contacts working as smugglers prior to joining the Rebellion.\n[P]Couriers acquire [B]Athletics, Deception, Streetwise,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the player may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience. In order to avoid Imperial entanglements, Couriers must be capable of operating without drawing attention to themselves. As they cannot expect to always succeed, these characters must also recognize the signs of trouble and have the ability to act quickly to escape entrapment. Because they often face overwhelming odds, personal speed is typically a higher priority than a trusted weapon.\n[P]Some Couriers prefer to work consistent routes as they shuttle information away from prying Imperial eyes. These specialists need a reliable cover story that they can use repeatedly. They might pose as merchants or transport drivers plying consistent trade routes. In a few instances, a Rebel might even take on the cover profession as a means of obtaining additional income, carrying innocuous cargo to market while smuggling critical information. Such Spies go to great lengths to ensure that their business interests are completely legitimate, so that they do not attract any undue attention. They also make sure that those interests are at least marginally profitable. A merchant who loses money consistently for years, after all, is just as likely to draw government attention as one who manages exorbitant profits. These individuals may even establish friendly relationships with the guards along their routes, and their frequent passage through Imperial territory becomes just a part of a station's routine traffic. In these cases, typically only a subset of their transits include military intelligence.\n[P]Other Couriers deliver critical data to Rebel specialists in a variety of locations instead of adopting a mundane occupation that involves travel on regular routes. Some are enthusiastic adrenaline junkies who call on wild speed and quick thinking to overcome Imperial security. More risk-averse Couriers simply excel at developing good cover stories and staying true to their roles during a mission. Adrenaline junkies or not, these Couriers are unlikely to have any established relationship with the local Imperial guards. Consequently, they must quickly determine how to bypass security or rely on other intelligence sources to prepare for it.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 24 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{"l7gh0xp808jrueyq":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"yhsmp2zs3ealltx4":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"7ox2umlb7ess0n96":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"0268z0v40ez61f1x":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"qug8monea7fopm80":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"pkk2xmjb1zdsb0yi":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"jbdz54r4ykrp2xpb":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"b0fbcvw13c5ldb17":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Indistinguishable","description":"Upgrade difficulty of checks to identify character once per rank of Indistinguishable.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"qACNEdLAI7IfPkHc","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Short Cut","description":"During a chase;

If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience.

In fact, most of the habitable places of the galaxy are rural or wilderness in nature. A specialization in Survivalist ensures a character has the necessary knowledge and training to make his way in such environments, and help the far more urban-minded folks he's likely traveling with.\n\n[P]Despite their capacity to live off the land, Survivalists enjoy credits and the things that can be purchased with them just like anyone else.

{"name":"Gambler","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Gambler -  The Wild Card[h4]\n\n[P]When the chips are down, the Gambler holds all the cards. Like the devious Thief, the Gambler loves misleading others and taking big risks to profit. Like the clever Trader, the Gambler has a knack for convincing others to part with their valuables for next to nothing. The Gambler has a unique variety of tricks up his sleeve to deceive or misdirect opponents, keeping them guessing as to whether he has a winning or losing hand. However, the Gambler knows that there is no such thing as a losing hand; winning is all about knowing how to play the cards that have been dealt.\n\n[P]The Gambler knows how to play all the most popular games of chance; however, he also recognizes there is far more to winning than just knowing the rules. His ability to identify subtle clues in the body language, mannerisms, voice patterns, and behavior of his opponents gives the Gambler all the information he needs to decide when to make his move. The Gambler prides himself on being unpredictable, denying his opponents any hints to his intentions with his stone-cold expression. Whether the situation is a game of sabacc, betting on Podraces, or talking a thug out of blasting his companions, the Gambler has a strategy, and rarely the one people expect.\n\n[P]The list of a Gambler's bonus career skills clearly shows his strong suit lies in sleight of hand and trickery: [B]Computers, Cool, Deception,[b] and [B]Skulduggery[b]. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending additional starting experience. By doubling down on skills that allow him to keep his opponents guessing, the Gambler ensures the odds are always stacked in his favor. As a competent liar, the Gambler is not above using a skitter to win a hand if the stakes are high enough.\n\n[P]A Gambler may not always look like much, but looks can be deceiving. The Gambler is an excellent actor, always able to project an air of calm confidence so he seems as cool as carbonite even when he is as tense as an Alderaanian on an ImpStar. A great Gambler knows to never count his credits at the table, so to speak, but sometimes playing hurt can throw his opponents. Some Gamblers love baiting their opponents by looking vulnerable just so they can gloat while raking in the pot. A fool and his money are soon parted, and the Gambler is always happy to oblige.\n\n[P]The Gambler is a fantastic specialization for playing a number of character types in a variety of settings. A player could create an aboveboard, aristocratic Core dweller participating in high-stakes betting just for thrills; a suave, small-time card shark flitting about the Colonies scamming amateur players; or a downtrodden Smuggler dropping his last fifty credits into the pot trying to win enough to repair his ship. He is not limited to playing games, however, as a Gambler fits into any setting where fists full of credits or unbelievable thrills are up for grabs. The negotiation skills of the Gambler could make him the brains of a trade or smuggling operation. A Thief may even supplement his abilities with Gambler to mingle among high society and case locations for upcoming jobs.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Fly Casual[h4]","attributes":{"kcjz9k12mmms3ea4":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"3qhz28pw8q4nr2qd":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ry4dkfrvl4kg4vx4":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"nuwopogyhl9a74qd":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"17o5tfwjjp8hknb0":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"hee9u0t2sx6calzu":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"l7i9l35urejo7g1p":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"72kbb6m83hd1kaie":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Convincing Demeanor","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Convincing Demeanor from any Deception or Skulduggery checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"JkBGqWp2M1MhktIh","attributes":{"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Skulduggery":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent3":{"name":"Up the Ante","description":"When gambling win 10% more credits per rank of Up the Ante.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Fly Casual[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"FkIBtzslrI3STYEa","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"links-top-1":true},"talent5":{"name":"Second Chances","description":"Once per encounter choose a number of positive dice equal to ranks in Second Changes and reroll them.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4][H4]Fly Casual[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"kizqwC3SL0m9c9JL","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true},"talent6":{"name":"Dedication","description":"Gain +1 to a single characteristic.

He maintains his composure under a blanket of blaster bolts, takes careful aim, and eliminates threats with ruthless efficiency and lightning speed. Sharpshooters are, simply, the masters of personal-scale ranged combat.\n\n[P]Not surprisingly, Sharpshooters gain [B]Cool, Perception, Ranged (Heavy),[b] and [B]Ranged (Light)[b] as career skills, and two of these gain a free rank if this is the first specialization for the PC. The focus on personal-scale ranged weapons is a natural fit for Sharpshooters, and their ability to take in their surroundings completely and assess targets carefully under high-stress situations is essential to their survival.\n\n[P]Most Sharpshooters are thoroughly comfortable with any ranged weapon, though many will focus attention and effort on mastering a single (often highly-personalized) weapon. Some prefer a sniper role, taking up a hidden position and removing threats from the field as invisible dealers of death. Other Sharpshooters prefer a more direct approach, blaster energy blazing in waves of destruction as they cover their teammates against hordes of Imperial soldiers.\n\n[P]The focus on individual excellence within the Alliance elevates the Sharpshooter over his typical counterpart in the Empire. He is encouraged to train to higher degrees of proficiency, and he is encouraged to master techniques of survival, depending on his team to stay alive. The average stormtrooper is given a decent amount of training, but the lack of attention to personal excellence means he will never reach the pinnacle of accuracy and deadly effectiveness attained by a Sharpshooter in the Rebellion.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 93 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"6im9lmntehei740z":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"k6ug089zx7hmxdrq":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"v0iou2lbx4hbms6o":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kgxb0yq9jpqzt3lj":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"4sp6p7hww8wuwa39":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"74xdbdy6h697kf8k":{"mod":"Ranged: Heavy","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"7q2n3ubrghi644le":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kof59309v3hffg30":{"mod":"Ranged: Light","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Expert Tracker","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Expert Tracker from checks to find tracks or track targets.

{"name":"Padawan Survivor","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Padawan Survivor - Fugitive Apprentices[h4]\nOrder 66 effectively erased the Jedi from existence, but a small handful of Padawans across the stars managed to escape. These young apprentices watched their closest allies suddenly turn and cut down Jedi and Padawans without warning. The remaining Padawan Survivors have been forced to hide their burgeoning abilities and enter a hostile galaxy alone and unprepared for life outside of the Jedi Order. However, a few have begun to emerge to fight back against the Empire that betrayed them.\n[P]The Padawan Survivor universal specialization does not have any career skills associated with it. When characters purchase this specialization, they automatically receive a Force rating of 1. If such characters already have a Force rating of 1 or higher, it does not improve when they purchase the Padawan Survivor specialization. Wary of a galaxy that has turned hostile, Padawan Survivors still put their faith in the Force as they were trained to do so from a young age.\n[P]As former apprentices, these Padawans had been on the path to becoming Jedi Knights. They received training in using the Force and in a range of fighting techniques. Unfortunately, their training was dominated with classroom lessons, and few had actual practical field experience unless they were allowed to join their masters in the Clone Wars. Not only was their formal training abruptly cut short, but the availability of Jedi knowledge was severely limited after the issuing of Order 66. That day was one of the darkest in the galaxy's history, and it devastated the rare Padawans that lived through it.\n[P]When the Jedi were branded as traitors and their order destroyed, those rare Padawans still alive were stranded with no resources and no support: their mentors were slain, their former clone trooper allies were hunting them as the Empire's behest, and they had no one from whom they could seek aid. In order to survive, these former apprentices were forced to seek no-questions-asked jobs or to subsist off a life of crime. If any Imperial informant began to suspect their Force abilities, they would be forced to flee.\n[P]As a result, many of the remaining Padawans abandoned their Jedi ideals and began nomadic lives. Many actively pursued any way to blend in, hide their abilities, and subsist on their own. Not all managed to remain hidden, though, with the might of the Empire and the newly-formed Inquisitorius after them at every turn.\n[P]While on the run, temporary allegiances were often all that was practical, as lasting bonds proved nearly impossible to maintain, especially when Padawans revealed their abilities. Saving a friend with the Force would frequently result in the friend's abandonment out of fear of the Empire. Only those already willing to defy the Empire would take that chance. A rebel cell, for instance, could take in Force users because the lives of its members were forfeit already. For Padawan Survivors, whose likes had been shattered by the Empire, rebellion was an exceptionally tempting opportunity.\n[P]Having access to an almost-extinguished source of power, Padawan Survivors are capable of unbelievable acts. Capable fighters and practiced at disappearing, they are able to effectively supplement a covert squad of rebel fighters or smuggles alike. The Force is a powerful ally, and these former Padawans are eager to again use it openly if it means honoring their dead masters and tearing down Imperial rule.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 102 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{"rv8u7zf959s162oa":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Parry","description":"When hit by a melee attack, suffer 3 strain to reduce damage by 2 plus ranks in Parry.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 149 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 35 - No Disintegrations[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidentalOutofTurn","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"F0cGoJwws7dKHq5I","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Constant Vigilance","description":"May always use Vigilance when making checks to determine initiative.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Endless Vigil[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"HbZwIFMvx4Al9Tam","attributes":{}},"talent2":{},"talent3":{"name":"Nobody's Fool","description":"May upgrade difficulty of incoming Charm, Coercion, or Deception checks once per rank of Nobody's Fool.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"R94udJt3yVpNQXv3","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent5":{"name":"Reflect","description":"When hit by a ranged attack, suffer 3 strain to reduce damage by 2 plus ranks in Reflect.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 150 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Active (Incidental, Out of Turn)","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsActiveIncidentalOutofTurn","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"PezCtNAmp3qm5xWs","attributes":{},"links-right":true},"talent6":{"name":"Sleight of Mind","description":"Add [BO] to all Stealth checks unless the opposition is immune to Force powers.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 156 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 152 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"nni1ghEkbwYnJ7fg","attributes":{"Stealth":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent7":{"name":"Secrets of the Jedi","description":"Lightsaber becomes a career skill.

{"name":"Hotshot","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Hotshot - The Loose Cannon[h4]\n\nWhere the Ace Pilot uses hard-won skill, technique, and by-the-book tactics, the Hotshot is naturally gifted, overly aggressive, and makes the rest up as he speeds along. For the Hotshot, risk-taking isn't just a style of flying, it's a way of life. You can always depend on a Hotshot to go for it when he sees an opportunity to achieve a goal. There are few things in the galaxy more impressive than watching a Hotshot when everything is going his way, though it's best to switch channels on the comms, because the only thing a Hotshot likes more than his own flying is bragging about it afterward.\n\n[P]The Rebellion has a nearly endless supply of new Hotshot bush pilots accustomed to racing T-16s on their backwater homeworlds, but very few Hotshot veterans. These courageous freedom fighters prefer improvisation to careful planning, much to their commanders' chagrin. Those Hotshots whose luck never seems to run out quickly become heroes and legends to the rank and file of the Rebel Alliance.\n[P]Hotshots receive [B]Cool, Coordination, Piloting (Planetary),[b] and [B]Piloting (Space)[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he gains one free rank in two of these skills of his choice, without spending experience. The Hotshot keeps his head in the face of overwhelming odds, and has a great degree of control over his chosen vehicle. Finesse and precision flying, combined with the Hotshot's unrestrained bravery, mean that Hotshots prefer to go after the toughest or biggest groups of enemies first, diving headlong into the thickest part of the battle.\n[P]The Hotshot is all about taking the big risks, both in combat and in life. He rarely considers the consequences or the alternatives. When he sees a chance, he takes it without blinking. This unpredictable and often irrational behavior, combined with the raw talent and control a Hotshot has in the cockpit, makes him a lethal adversary. Of course, there is no reward without risk, and sometimes the Hotshot risks too much. If not for the support of their allies, most Hotshots would probably have died a dozen times over.\n\n[P]The Rebellion usually puts Hotshots through their paces in simulators before letting them get into a real fight. However, the Rebels can't afford to keep their best combat Aces sidelined for long. Command usually assigns Hotshots to X-wing or A-wing squadrons, or to other light, maneuverable vehicles that take full advantage of a Hotshot's preternatural skill. Veteran Hotshots are usually retired once their value as a symbol eclipses whatever good they might do on the battlefield. High Command often parades them around on low-risk, high-visibility missions, or transfers them to training commands.\n\n[P]Any group can benefit from the honed dogfighting skills of a Hotshot. However, despite the Hotshot's predilection for flying into combat ahead of his squadron, he works best when he has a team not far behind, cleaning up whatever enemies the Hotshot misses.

{"name":"Armorer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Armorer - The Smith[h4]\nArmorers are defined by their ability to survive through a combination of ingenuity and stubbornness. While Protectors draw directly on the Force to avoid harm and Soresu Defenders use lightsabers to deflect incoming strikes, Armorers build a better defense, reinforcing solidly built equipment with the inestimable power of the Force.\n[P]Armorers gain [B]Knowledge (Outer Rim), Lightsaber, Mechanics,  and Resilience[b] as additional career skills. These skills help Armorers in getting the tools they need for the job, maintaining and using those implements efficiently, and surviving to do it all again. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Armorers wield a number of talents that enhance their own armor and defenses, letting them survive hits that would fell most of their allies. They are extremely skilled craftspeople, and not only can build and modify their own gear proficiently, but can also use the Force to bolster their handiwork. With sufficient training, Armorers can imbue their armor with the power of the Force, allowing it to repel blows from lightsabers.\n[P]Thanks to their sturdy defenses, Armorers often favor close-quarters combat, trusting their protection to see them through to melee range. Though lightsabers are practically legendary in this era of oppression, some Armorers manage to acquire the kyber crystals necessary to forge these weapons. The most skilled Armorers can even use their innate knowledge of the Force to unlock unseen potential in more mundane items, bringing out qualities that others have overlooked. This mystical ability, combined with an Armorer's natural resourcefulness, means that catching an Armorer unarmed and unready grants only a minimal advantage.\n[P]Though they certainly benefit from having a fully stocked machine shop available, Armorers can also do most of their work on the battlefield, scrounging and retrofitting the supplies they need. This flexibility can be a substantial advantage in [B]Force and Destiny[b], for the Empire hounds every step that Force users take, and they must be able to adapt to shifting circumstances and surroundings. If a vessel needs repairing behind enemy lines or a hull breach must be sealed during a firefight, an Armorer is often the best sentient being for the job.\n[P]Outside of combat, Armorers can be extremely helpful to their allies. In addition to possessing considerable skill at modifying equipment, they can repair vehicles and other machines that the group needs kept in working order. While Artisans have the edge in refined skill with technology and the deep research into matters involving machines, Armorers can get the job done, and do it under enemy fire.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 24 - Keeping the Peace[h4]","attributes":{"x0fjwnlps0f24deg":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"79zcihyteoygbe3g":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ji6o5x2gsg76d5kx":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"zin0dzj3zvpogrxj":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"z2osft0li07bjczr":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"myekl39terr1xdm7":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Toughened","description":"Gain +2 wound threshold.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"4GBGKJNMp97IBIKU","attributes":{"mpyd51s9x8jg1j9b":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":2}}},"talent2":{"name":"Gearhead","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Gearhead from Mechanics checks.

{"name":"Seer","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Seer[h4]\n\nSome individuals are able to remain constantly aware of the Force's presence, even as they go about their daily lives. They recognize its influence in the subtlest of ways. For them, minor ripples in the Force reveal deep meanings and forewarn of critical events far in the future. However, this quantity of information—particularly in environments filled with other sentients—can become overwhelming. Because of this, many who follow the path of the Seer choose to live lives of relative isolation, far from crowded towns and cities.\n\n[P]Seers acquire [B]Discipline, Knowledge (Lore), Survival,[b] and [B]Vigilance[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. Successful Seers must be able to maintain focus on daily life even as they also observe the Force. They must learn to recognize a broad range of subtle signs. They must also be prepared to dwell in a potentially hostile environment, apart from civilization, so that they can be spared from information overload.\n\n[P]Among Force-sensitive individuals, Seers are arguably the ones who feel the strongest sense of guidance from the Force. Dwelling within the Force at all times, they can recognize even minor ripples and follow them to their source to stop a small problem from turning into a major crisis. Similarly, they may recognize an event that occurs far away and advise those nearby to take action so they can be prepared well in advance of an upcoming crisis. Seers' abilities often give them insights into the future, guiding them to places and people who most need their wisdom and advice. This sometimes enables Seers to be in just the right place at the right time to take action that proves to be pivotal.\n\n[P]The challenge for many Seers is to know the best time to move into a civilized area. As their sensitivity can become muddled, they may miss a sign of great import. Consequently, some prefer to remain apart from society for as long as possible, depending on allies to carry their missives. Seldom, however, are others capable of communicating a warning as effectively as the Seer who initially sensed the danger.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 83 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"mmfr6d1gu9lzflbt":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"x7gyeak66ipsp32n":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"jxzhfoxxvvkawajb":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"jobhordpm5ga0299":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"yqorz7yuitsnackg":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"caz0b4z5i6olucbp":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Forager","description":"Remove up to [SE][SE] from skill checks to find food, water, or shelter.

{"name":"Force Sensitive Outcast","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Force-Sensitive Outcast[h4]\nThe Jedi and the Sith are not the sole masters of the Force. The Force awakens in all manner of beings from all walks of life, and while many Force sensitives are discovered by the Jedi—or on rare occasions, by the Sith—no one can say how many go unrecorded. Some Force sensitives receive training in the ways of the Jedi or Sith only to leave in pursuit or their own agendas, whether by choice or expulsion. These are the Force-Sensitive Outcasts, the independent Force users who stay on the outskirts of the galaxy and reject the dogma of the Jedi and the Sith. With a lightsaber at their side and the power of the Force at their fingertips, a Force-Sensitive Outcast is master of their own destiny. [B]A character who purchases this specialization gains a Force rating of 1.[b] If they already had a Force rating of 1 or higher, it does not increase.\n\n[H4]A LIFE ON THE EDGE[h4]\n\n[P]Life isn't easy for a Force-Sensitive Outcast, who must contend not only with the political might of the Republic and the Separatists, but also with the reach of the Jedi and the Sith. Many characters who forge their own path do so as smugglers, bounty hunters, or criminals, using their talents to gain wealth or influence outside of the law. Yet, a Force-Sensitive Outcast is not necessarily an outlaw at heart, and their clashes with Republic authority may stem from personal conflicts with the Jedi Order.\n\n[P]The doctrine of the Jedi is not welcoming to everyone, and the restrictions on attachment often conflict with a Force-Sensitive Outcast's values. Some Padawans are naturally adept with the dark side of the Force, strongly feeling its pull no matter how hard they try to heed their masters’ teachings. In rare cases, a Force user might receive training from a Sith Lord, whether within the confines of the Rule of Two or as a secret apprentice. Other Force users might find that their desire for freedom outweighs the benefit of having a mentor leading them to choose the self-taught path. This may eventually bring them into contact with the Jedi or Sith—if that is the will of the Force.\n\n[P]The reach of the Jedi is long, but not all-encompassing. Those who have rejected the Jedi or evaded or refused recruitment are masters at survival and subterfuge, using the Force and their own self-sufficiency to help them persist in a harsh galaxy. Experience is an effective teacher, and Force-Sensitive Outcasts are uniquely situated to learn all manner of tricks and tactics. Despite having little or no proper training in the ways of the Force, such iconoclasts may have skills that rival or exceed those of Jedi in certain areas.\n\n[P]Due to the abundance of Force users during the time of the Republic, it is possible for a non-Jedi to acquire a lightsaber. The blade of a fallen Jedi has been known to appear on the black market, and those who train with the Jedi or the Sith often walk away with their own lightsaber, regardless of the circumstances of the parting. However a Force-Sensitive Outcast acquires such a weapon, it becomes a tangible symbol of their unique talents.\n\n[P]Many of a Force-Sensitive Outcast's combat skills are likely self-taught, making their battle techniques diverse and unpredictable. They often fight with a pieced-together combination of different formal lightsaber styles, remembering elements of their training (if they had any) and the maneuvers of other lightsaber-wielding combatants, and incorporating them into traditional sword-fighting techniques—with a fair amount of improvisation. A Force-Sensitive Outcast may be a less refined warrior than a Jedi or Sith, but they are no less deadly.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 29 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","attributes":{"peougkot3fjbebsm":{"mod":"ForcePool","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Uncanny Reactions","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Uncanny Reactions to all Vigilance checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"IJ5wgsvxJK1IZ7mG","attributes":{"Vigilance":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Sense Emotions","description":"Add [BO] to all Charm, Coercion, and Deception checks unless the target is immune to Force powers.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"l44nXw8HTdGKbhBs","attributes":{"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Coercion":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent3":{"name":"Uncanny Senses","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Uncanny Senses to all Perception checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"DXUoFuMB2aVMhu4w","attributes":{"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"talent4":{"name":"Quick Draw","description":"Once per round, draw or holster a weapon or accessible item as an incidental.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"WnFEG0VUywqagDXi","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true},"talent5":{"name":"Quick Strike","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Quick Strike to combat checks against targets that have not acted yet this encounter.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"9Fywc1fbC1WuNKC6","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent6":{"name":"Disorient","description":"After hitting with combat check, may spend [AD][AD] to disorient target for number of rounds equal to ranks in Disorient.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"8eY8kXYQd5cJjrl2","attributes":{}},"talent7":{"name":"Secrets of the Force","description":"Knowledge (Lore) and Lightsaber become career skills[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 42 -

{"name":"Hermit","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Hermit - Communing with the Living Force[h4]\nWhile most Seekers are often solitary and self-reliant by nature, some go beyond this simple tendency toward reclusion and desire to operate independently. A life isolated from the impositions and irritations of outsiders is instead the goal for them, so that they can develop their abilities and connections to the Force in relative calm. Free from outside distractions, these Hermits can further themselves in ways previously unimaginable to them. Those who can be convinced to rejoin society can be of great value, ont only int heir use of the Force but also in dealing with wilderness survival and deadly creatures.\n[P]For Hermits, solitude is not necessarily a result of abhorring social interactions or lacking any skills with them. Some Hermits might have even sought remote life to escape from outside entanglements. They may have had crushing debts, had bounties placed on their heads, or even deserted from the Imperial military. Hermits who desire seclusion after discovering their nascent Force abilities may use their isolation to more fully concentrate on uncovering the secrets of their mysterious new powers. Meditation can not only help them become more in tune with the Force, but also strengthen their connection with nature and the surrounding wildlife.\n[P]Hermits are not only solitary and self-reliant, but also seek to maintain their isolation against intruders and others who would disturb their reclusive existence. Some even hone their ability to avoid others to a great extent, the better to escape unwanted attention. To represent this, Hermits receive [B]Discipline[b], [B]Knowledge (Xenology)[b], [B]Stealth[b], and [B]Survival[b] as additional career skills, allowing them to better develop their connections not only with the Force, but also with local flora and fauna. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Despite their previously isolated ways of life, Hermits are powerful additions to groups. When parties are stranded in harsh environments, whether sweltering jungles or barren ice wastelands, Hermits likely feel they are returning to their homes. Many find such locations more relaxing than the intense industry adn frantic pace of typical cities especially in Core Systems. Their skills in dealing with these wilderness regions makes them invaluable for ensuring the party's survival when the characters venture into the wilds.\n[P]Hermits' skills in uncivilized areas also comes into play when facing dangerous animals or untamed creatures the group desires to use as steeds. Living in the wild, Hermits often develop close bonds with their fellow creatures and can form companionships that might last lifetimes. Many of these Seekers use their Force abilities, possibly unconsciously, to strengthen established connections with animals as well as to form new ones.\n[P]Despite having lived in isolation for long periods, Hermits are not unprepared for conflict. Most have maintained themselves well, simply in order to survive in an unforgiving wilderness where weather and even local plant life can be as hostile as any sentient enemy. Dealing with dangerous creatures and honing themselves to avoid such attacks can turn Hermits into equally dangerous combatants. Overall, this solitude can build powerful individuals, able not only to thrive in the harshest of environments but also to aid others unprepared for life outside advanced urban settings.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Savage Spirits[h4]","attributes":{"dmhre940v06xf8qd":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"874exk0xa0v5qh2l":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"kuebzemvqly4j6fx":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"inmhb4ut72jojlwk":{"mod":"Stealth","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"p18c9w64km9onqsk":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"8uopgl2ndg6a92sn":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Forager","description":"Remove up to [SE][SE] from skill checks to find food, water, or shelter.

These skilled artificers can use their skill with the Force to enhance their abilities, and even intuitively understand a machine's form and function. After all, while tools and machines may not be alive, the Force envelopes everything in the galaxy. Artisans feel the Force that surrounds their tools and the items they work on, using this connection to build creations of wondrous beauty and precision. An Artisan does not create scores of the same item for sale Of distribution. Instead, each of his creations is individual and iconic, a true work of art.\n\n[P]Artisans acquire [B]Astrogation, Computers, Knowledge (Education),[b] and [B]Mechanics[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. In order to fully integrate their Force abilities with the devices they manipulate, Artisans must first have a solid understanding of how those tools work. This requires a fundamental educational grounding in the principles of technology.\n\n[P]Within urban environments, individuals who never learn to recognize their Force talents are prone to follow the Artisan's path. This is because they are surrounded by technology, and if these individuals take an interest in how things work and how to repair them, their Force abilities may naturally develop in concert. When faced with a broken machine, they can often identify the problem in an intuitive way—some even claim that the machines \"speak\" to them. Some Artisans live up to the stereotype of the messy inventor, while others remain meticulously neat or even take pains to disguise their craftsmanship from casual observers.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 93 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"3ntofkj0nlglhxpe":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"3jln1frg13574mag":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"tpggneywgch17eit":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"txjphrircmmm9slg":{"mod":"Computers","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"5vj29y8eu2pficvq":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"v5lddvteh2oimc5w":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Solid Repairs","description":"The character repairs +1 hull trauma per rank of Solid Repairs whenever he repairs a starship or vehicle.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"PSvQU3xeIo0LLGiT","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Fine Tuning","description":"When reducing the amount of system strain a starship or vehicle suffers, reduce 1 additional strain per rank of Fine Tuning.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"svvZw254t5eCyj1j","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Mental Tools","description":"Always count as having the right tools for the job when performing Mechanics checks.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":true,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"p4FTvBC4ETR0KxA6","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Technical Aptitude","description":"Reduces time needed to complete Computer-related tasks by 25% per rank.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"6PtO1tUTY1yyRdMa","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent5":{"name":"Solid Repairs","description":"The character repairs +1 hull trauma per rank of Solid Repairs whenever he repairs a starship or vehicle.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"PSvQU3xeIo0LLGiT","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent6":{"name":"Fine Tuning","description":"When reducing the amount of system strain a starship or vehicle suffers, reduce 1 additional strain per rank of Fine Tuning.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"svvZw254t5eCyj1j","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent7":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}},"links-top-1":true},"talent8":{"name":"Inventor","description":"When constructing new items or modifying existing attachments, add [BO] or remove [SE] per rank of Inventor.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"pZJt4ikpzFifIGc4","attributes":{},"links-top-1":true,"links-right":true},"talent9":{"name":"Imbue Item","description":"Take the Imbue Item maneuver; suffer 1 strain and commit [FO] to grant one weapon, piece of armor, or item an improvement while [FO] remains committed.

{"name":"Clone Pilot","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Clone Pilot[h4]\nInterplanetary conflict inevitably brings battles to the upper atmosphere and the void of space. Capital ships play a prominent role in these battles, but large wings of starfighters are a vital part of every conflict. These specialized ships exploit their smaller profile and variations in armament to avoid detection while occupying a variety of roles. Military transports deploy from capital ships—often through active war zones in the company of starfighter screens—to deliver troops and equipment to a planet's surface, where clones can engage the enemy.\nEvery Clone Soldier has the rudimentary knowledge required to pilot repulsorlift vehicles, walkers, and starfighters. However, basic skills alone are inadequate for success in a combat environment. To address this, some Clone Soldiers receive additional training in the Clone Pilot specialization and are inducted into the Republic Navy branch of the Grand Army of the Republic.\nClone Pilots receive Gunnery, Mechanics, Piloting (Planetary), and Piloting (Space) as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience. A degree of familiarity with these skills is vital for any Clone Soldier to survive as a starfighter pilot. While any battlefield is profoundly dangerous, the vacuum of space adds significant risks that are not present during typical planetary conflicts. Additional training mitigates some of those dangers but can never completely eliminate them.[P]\nClone Pilots serve as members of a squadron under the command of a Clone Officer, who has also mastered the skills of a pilot. A squadron is typically assigned a particular type of craft, although this can change based on mission requirements. Clone Pilots are sometimes reassigned to other squadrons in which they are expected to fly other craft. Consequently, their training includes exposure to a range of starfighters, speeders, and walkers.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 21 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","attributes":{"hynd2qekzmntsjde":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"0xidqv14uzlcima2":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"93omlxx5i56958qr":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"pjb9yf1n9phutwit":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"49ohbrezdc59qhv8":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"2bavf8z3mnkfevlx":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"mhy0hus0pj9kgypi":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"g8n2hezbyu6ixgrg":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Let's Ride","description":"Once per round, may mount or dismount a vehicle or beast, or enter a cockpit or weapon station on a vehicle, as an incidental.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"WzgPaIcxanw2TsMC","attributes":{}},"talent1":{"name":"Fire Support","description":"After the character makes a successful combat check using a vehicle weapon the next ally to make a check adds [BO] equal to ranks of Fire Support[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 41 -

{"name":"Alchemist","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Alchemist - Giving Life to the Inanimate[h4]\nDuring the era of the Galactic Republic, the Jedi Order never embraced alchemy. Various spiritual orders that had worked in alchemy also allied with the dark side of the Force. The Sith, the Nightsisters of Dathomir, and the Frangawl Cult on Bardotta all used the dark side to power their weapons, talismans, and magicks. Whether or not the Jedi thought that alchemy led to the dark side of the Force has been lost to time. Perhaps the Order felt that giving life to the inanimate, pouring the Force into a dead object, replicated the act of giving life, of giving birth, or of playing god, and would cause the Jedi to become prideful.\n[P]With the rise of the Empire and the loss of the Jedi Order, now no one can warn a potential Alchemist away from practicing this lost art. This might be just as well. Just like any technology, it isn't the object but the user that makes it good or bad, light or dark, useful or destructive. In addition, the Force flows through everything, even inanimate objects. Rocks have a measure of the Force in them. How else could a Jedi move them? With that reasoning, nothing should prevent a Jedi from imbuing a machine with the Force, save the Jedi's own fears, hatred, and obsessions.\n[P]An Alchemist's additional career skills are [B]Knowledge (Education), Knowledge (Xenology), Medicine,[b] and [B]Resilience[b]. Upon character creation, if this is the character's first specialization, pick two of these skills to automatically gain one rank in each.\n[P]The Jedi built their own lightsabers not only for ritual or training purposes, but to infuse a bit of their own essence into the weapon. The Jedi consciously and deliberately built these weapons both as a technical test and as a meditative test. It could be argued that a lightsaber contains the presence of its creator-and perhaps its user(s).\n[P]Force alchemy extends this idea and discipline further, crafting physical objects infused with the power of the Force. These objects appear to have a life of their own, and in the eyes of a Force sensitive, perhaps they do. This creates a metaphysical conundrum: if an object possesses a measure of the Force, how is it different from a living being?\n[P]Alchemists tend to focus on medicinal concoctions, since the healing of a physical body is the most direct method of using and influencing the Force. The flow of a medicine, tincture, salve, or draught mimics the flow of the Force. Alchemists can work in other materials, but this requires more training and attention. A malformed or malfunctioning machine can't be fixed with an infusion of the Force. In many ways, it might exacerbate the damage.\n[P]Folktales and popular holovids of machines coming to life and terrorizing their creators and innocents may be based on true stories of Alchemists who fell to the dark side of the Force. Force-infused objects can be tortured as much as any living creature. When the Alchemist is a dark side user, alchemical machines take on a sinister and dangerous aura, \"malfunctioning\" to cause harm or, in the case of a weapon, increasing suffering when it does cause harm.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Unlimited Power[h4]","attributes":{"nbs4uzgboln8782v":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"knzkioeky2u0todb":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"nwk7w6836re88uln":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"2p22ynr2t360aklo":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Stimpack Specialization","description":"Stimpacks heal 1 additional wound per rank of Stimpack Specialization.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 157 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 152 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"POiVv9VE32d6tpY5","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Researcher","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Researcher from all Knowledge checks.

This holds just as true when resolving disputes or negotiations as it does on the battlefield. A Sage focuses on studying the world around him, recognizing that information offers tremendous advantages to himself and his allies. He then uses that power to help change the hearts and minds of others to achieve his goals.\n\n[P]Equal parts scholar and diplomat, Sages gain the additional career skills [B]Astrogation, Charm, Cool,[b] and [B]Knowledge (Lore)[b]. If this is a PC's first specialization, the PC gains one rank in each of two of these skills. Sages see knowledge and understanding as the basis for long-term peace and harmony. It is their belief that hatred often springs from ignorance. When a sentient comes to appreciate the backgrounds of another being's beliefs and practices, it becomes far easier not only accept that being but to feel compassion for him.\n[P]Some researchers may become lost in their academic pursuits, obsessing over dry facts while blind to the plight of the weak and helpless. Not so a Sage, who maintains connections to those around him via the Living Force. The Force provides a means of grounding Sages' studies so that they keep what they learn in perspective, always mindful of how they can use their knowledge to help others.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 71 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"q35jtuk52yfscayd":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ed6kin14oziy6gh2":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"r74tur8vqjr1h3w1":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"kp7fnvdxczepz35d":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"zqusllnrfxpp01hk":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"cdo5gnoiskmr91nu":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Kill With Kindness","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Kill with Kindness from all Charm and Leadership checks.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"QtzzTgVNnnjRrphd","attributes":{"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1},"Leadership":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":1}}},"talent2":{"name":"Researcher","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Researcher from all Knowledge checks.

If this is the first specialization for a PC, two of these four skills gain a free rank when they are chosen.

They relish both the daily challenge of keeping a ship and its crew operating at peak capacity and facing the strategic challenges of capital ship engagements. The greatest Commodores find themselves managing not just a single ship, but a fleet of them, matching wits against their enemy counterparts in a huge game with very deadly consequences for each and every piece in play.\n\n[P]Effective Commodores are even more precious than Pilots for the Alliance Navy.

If those items actually seem to work better afterward, that Technician might well be a Modder. Modders are chronic tinkerers, and most Modders would rather add features to machines they already have than build new ones. By turning their engineering prowess toward relentlessly repairing, optimizing, testing, calibrating and re-repairing mechanisms around them. Modders make any piece of technology their own - even if it isn't, strictly speaking, theirs.\n[P]A Modder can be extremely versatile; in some ways a modder specializes in generalizing. By spending less time and energy learning how to build devices from the ground up, a Modder can focus on how to optimize and customize all sorts of devices - from weapons to ships, droids to personal gear. Of course, one project might hold a Modder's interest more than others, at least for a while. The Modder's talents allow a character to focus heavily on a single project or flit from one exciting upgrade to another at a moment's notice. Whether it's a starship engine or a shiny new blaster, a Modder can probably find a way to make it better.\n[P]Modders receive [B]Gunnery, Mechanics, Piloting (Space)[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] as bonus career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the Modder may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Many teams of renegades and rogues benefit from having a Modder around, as this character can offer a number of unique upgrades to starships and vehicles as well as better access to attachments for  weapons. Modders can certainly be competent pilots and combatants in their own right. Modders who seek out battle in person benefit from a high Agility. With or without an investment in this characteristic though, combat-oriented Modders are most effective when backed up by teams of specialists carrying the souped-up firepower and piloting the uniquely customized ships that only Modders can provide.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 32 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{"6lv60lw9h0a09x4i":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"5wel310825ld8nsf":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"xeozbyrojbooc6hd":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"w581vhup9so3p9x6":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"xvvrop602mgbenwa":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"8yvgoe8bnyt1wf9h":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"okppj85259dzccqa":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"wrpu69scymoueeph":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Tinkerer","description":"May add 1 additional hard point to a number of items equal to ranks in Tinkerer.

If this is the character's starting Specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. A Politico might join a discussion, speech, or debate in any number of ways. With his talents, he might act to inspire greatness in those around him, or he might know just what to say to cut an opponent to the core, diminishing his confidence and leaving him vulnerable.\n[P]Politicos in the Outer Rim are usually up to something; ambition is hardwired into their very being. They may not yet know what they wish to accomplish, but when they see an opportunity to achieve some kind of greater goal, they will turn all their will and personality towards achieving it. Politicos might sign on to temporarily work for another, but they will not long be happy in a subservient role. Leadership is the core of who they are.\n\n[P]In a group, the Politico works best as the front-man, or the \"face.\" More than anyone, he is best suited for initial contacts with any being or group, and he's the best to have at any negotiation, social gathering, or interrogation.

{"name":"Colossus","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Colossus - Indefatigable and Invincible[h4]\n\nMost Warriors pride themselves on their ability to overcome pain. A Colossus, however, possesses a toughness far beyond that. While many fighters wear their scars with pride, an experienced Colossus ripples with scar tissue, the evidence of wounds enough to kill a normal combatant a dozen times over. Where other Warriors might seek to end conflicts quickly and decisively, a Colossus possesses the stamina, endurance, and strength of will to fight through inconceivable pain and punishment, outlasting the foe no matter the odds.\n[P]Colossus characters receive [B]Brawl, Discipline, Melee,[b] and [B]Resilience[b], as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the player chooses two of these skills and gains one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. These skills allow Colossi to endure great punishment both mentally and physically, and to ensure that they are prepared for even the most taxing situations and battles.\n[P]Knowingly or not, Colossi reflect a number of stoic Force traditions that arose throughout history. Some of these beliefs influenced the Jedi Order, particularly in teachings of the primacy of the mental and spiritual over the physical. By accepting the transience of physical pain, a Warrior can rise above it. Some arrive at such a state of mind independently, perhaps realizing (aided by a robust constitution) that physical pain is passing, and only makes them stronger.\n[P]Becoming a true Colossus is rarely a matter of formal training, and there is no single path. Few sentients have the physical endurance or the mental reserves for this approach to combat. Those who do might hone their natural abilities through a number of means, likely never quite the same. Being a Colossus may mean transcending their natural physical limitations through meditation and focus, maintaining an internal calm even in the midst of ferocious battle. Others take the opposite approach, drawing on their pain and the negative emotions it evokes to fuel themselves in combat. This latter method is representative of those who tread closer to the dark side.\n[P]Although all who fit the mold of a Colossus share certain traits when it comes to defense and longevity, they can take very different approaches to dishing out damage. There is no particular fighting style that defines a Colossus's approach to attacking. Some might heft a heavy blaster. wading heedlessly through enemy fire to unleash a salvo. Others prefer hefty vibro-axes, swords, or other melee weapons, getting up close to enemies and trading blows, confident in their ability to take punishment and give it back in turn. Regardless of their preferred approach, Colossi are sure to have the strength to overcome an opponent with well-placed strikes should the opportunity arise.\n[P]Whether by focusing on suffering or by aspiring to higher ideals, a Colossus achieves a preternatural level of physical hardiness and toughness by drawing on the Force. A hardened Force user possesses reserves of willpower to fight on despite agonizing wounds. More importantly, Colossi can allow the Force to flow through them, using it to achieve impossible feats of endurance. They may be blasted and slashed, but their wounds do not bleed. They walk on broken legs and continue the fight, though it might worsen their injuries.

Snubfighters, small gunships, combat airspeeders, and hovertanks go hammer-and-tongs against the massive Imperial war machine, and it's only the tactical genius and daring of those who lead these units keeping them alive. The best Squadron Leaders even manage to pull out more than their fair share of victories.\n\n[P]Squadron Leaders have access to [B]Gunnery, Mechanics, Piloting (Planetary),[b] and [B]Piloting (Space)[b] as their additional career skills. As the first specialization choices, two of these skills can begin with a free rank. Squadron Leaders tend to know their machines very well, and of course they need to be able to operate the same types of vehicles they are commanding.\n\n[P]Squadron Leaders rarely lead from the rear. More often than not, theirs are the first ships or vehicles to engage the enemy, and they're the last ones out of a combat zone Of they get out at all). Leading by example is a way of life for a Squadron Leader, and he won't ask anyone to do what he's not ready to do himself. He rides his team to keep their machines in top shape, and he trains them constantly. He wants both crew and machines back in the hangar when the mission is over, and he does whatever it takes to make it happen.\n\n[P]Alliance High Command knows every single battle is important, and most of them are won at the front line, by mechanized detachments and starfighter squadrons under the command of Squadron Leaders. The upper echelons are constantly on the lookout for anyone with the right qualities to inspire and lead pilots and vehicle crews into the worst kinds of hell and back again.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 74 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"8jr6m74g9lrulvrm":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"huc66ft0rfnkn5b9":{"mod":"Gunnery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"6s6cqupsxs4pvi2l":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"47mykj3phvl4q5e7":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"w68rt1rir4yzym64":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"taqi3ihih5eud22r":{"mod":"Piloting: Planetary","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ai7iaqpkjwnkarmm":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"b6plzcdshbuls6qv":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Quick Strike","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Quick Strike to combat checks against targets that have not acted yet this encounter.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"9Fywc1fbC1WuNKC6","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Let's Ride","description":"Once per round, may mount or dismount a vehicle or beast, or enter a cockpit or weapon station on a vehicle, as an incidental.","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":false,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"WzgPaIcxanw2TsMC","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Defensive Driving","description":"Increase defense of vehicle or starship being piloted by 1 per rank of Defensive Driving.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 134 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 145 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"EQMzyKT5SyWqgiWO","attributes":{}},"talent4":{"name":"Field Commander","description":"Take the Field Commander action; make a [B]Average ([DI][DI]) Leadership check[b].

{"name":"Investigator","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Investigator - A Living Chronicle[h4]\n\n\nInvestigators examine unsolved crimes, using their knowledge and skills to figure out the who, what, when, where, and why. They don't seek this information merely to satisfy some obsession over the ugly side of society but rather to honor the victims by bringing the perpetrators to justice.\n[P]Investigators receive [B]Knowledge (Education)[b], [B]Knowledge (Underworld)[b], [B]Perception[b] and [B]Streetwise[b] as additional career skills. Characters who select this as their starting specialization may choose two  of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]Investigators piece together what has been lost or stolen by uncovering the past. Weaving the stories of what happened into a living chronicle, they discover secrets and untangle lies. Only by understanding the how and why of a crime can Investigators bring the one who did it to justice.\n[P]Since crimes are inflicted upon (and inflicted by) people these acts leave an impression in the Force. Particularly violent crimes leave a strong disturbance. Extremely evil crimes leave a wound—a cold, dark space that frightens the unwary and consumes the foolhardy. Investigators can tease out details from those impressions, unwinding them so they can heal. In many ways, investigators are physicians for the souls of communities, solving festering mysteries, airing out toxic secrets, and cauterizing hidden crimes.\n[P]These violent impressions can also affect individuals. Even if they haven't witnessed the crime in question, investigators have heard rumors, have felt their community suffer, and can read their peers with the insight of an insider. In many ways, a community functions as a single, living organism, and damage to that organism reverberates in both predictable and surprising ways. By tracing those symptoms, Investigators get to the source.\n[P]Investigators have many tools in their kits besides the Force. Understanding the local customs and language, being familiar with the unspoken rules of a community, and knowing how to bluff their way into a back-room requires knowledge and social skills. Slicing a security camera picking a lock to search an apartment, or staking out a person of interest in an investigation means breaking laws without getting caught. And sometimes—oftentimes—successfully sneaking into and out of a building can bring the Investigator one step closer to the truth.\n[P]The greatest tools of Investigators, though, can often become their greatest weaknesses. Their emotions can help them understand a person's motives giving context to a fact. If a perpetrator killed a dangerous drug lord, is that persona  murderer or a savior? However, emotions can cloud an investigator's judgment. If the good friend who saved a life turns out to be a slaver, is it betrayal to turn that friend in? Finally, the constant exposure to suffering can burn out even the most stalwart Investigators.\n[P]In the final analysis, Investigators see crime and victimization as a corruption of the Force. They feel the Force as something that flows through people, affecting their health, psychology, and well-being. A corruption of the Force makes people angrier, more fearful, and more likely to lash out and harm others. These constant cuts caused by crime chip away at a society wounding the Force until the whole society falls to the dark side. Airing out the source of the wound allows the society to finally heal.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 24 - Endless Vigil[h4]","attributes":{"6g44lji5x5sy3haf":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"nt5htf8j87g96t7w":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"dmmf3p2lcsa1god7":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"7ma2smi8d288mqae":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{},"talent1":{"name":"Keen Eyed","description":"Remove [SE] per rank of Keen Eyed from Perception and Vigilance checks.

He also sees his role as the defender of all who ride with him in whatever vehicle he's crewing.\n\n[P]Gunners gain [B]Discipline, Gunnery, Ranged (Heavy),[b] and [B]Resilience[b] as additional career skills; they get a free rank in two of these if this is their first specialization. Gunners are often faced with terrifying odds or unknown threats requiring nerves of steel. When their positions are overrun, hand-to-hand fighting is often the only choice they have. Larger blasters and similar ranged weapons are also often of interest to the Gunner.\n\n[P]Whether the Gunner is laying down a field of fire from the door of a transport ship in a hot landing zone or firing pinpoint volleys at a star cruiser's shield generators, he is more than comfortable with the idea of possessing large amounts of firepower. He knows the value of what he does, and the sheer thrill of unleashing so much devastation with each pull of the trigger is very satisfying. The resultant explosion of an enemy target is a payoff worth far more than any moment of glory.\n\n[P]Proficient Gunners are a true asset in the Alliance, and the best ones are usually assigned to the most important defensive posts, assault vehicles, and ships.

{"name":"Figurehead","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Figurehead - Charismatic Leaders[h4]\n\nFigureheads generally come from civilian backgrounds\nand aren’t necessarily a part of the Alliance\nMilitary’s chain of command. They rely on their reputations,\npolitical connections, and charisma to accomplish\ntheir goals. Though their aims might not align\nperfectly with those of the other Commander careers,\nthe respect they command due to their political legacies\nensures that they continue\nto be a motivating factor in both\npolitical and military circles within\nthe Rebel Alliance. Examples of\nFigureheads in the Rebel Alliance\ninclude Mon Mothma and\nthe late Bail Organa, as well\nas his adopted daughter,\nPrincess Leia\nOrgana.\n[P]Figureheads receive [B]Cool, Leadership, Negotiation,[b]\nand [B]Knowledge (Core Worlds)[b] as additional career\nskills. If this is the character’s starting specialization,\nthe player may choose two of these skills and gain\none free rank in each without spending experience.\nMany Commanders focus their social aptitudes on\nskills that help them get people to do what they want,\nsuch as Coercion. Figureheads, on the other hand, get\nwhat they want through subtle manipulations, preferring\nto persuade those under their command to do\nwhat must be done.\n[P]Much of a Figurehead’s repertoire consists of personal\nfortitude, as bearing the hopes and fears of\ntheir people is a Figurehead’s primary focus. Cool\nis especially important, for it allows a Figurehead\nto gain the trust and admiration of subordinates.\nFigureheads’ demeanor must inspire those who\nadmire them, allowing their followers to overcome\ntheir personal qualms—including fear—in order to\nstrike a blow against the Galactic Empire. Whether\nthis inspiring quality applies to a Figurehead’s physical\nappearance depends on the character’s personal\nstyle; many Figureheads have turned their scars and\nthe wounds they’ve suffered into inspirational messages\nall their own.\n[P]Figureheads who take a more active role in resisting\nthe Empire's oppression often do so through\nleadership and inspiration. The confidence and\nknow-how of a trained leader is much more convincing\nunder fire than good looks and a pithy slogan.\nSeeing action in combat also serves to bolster a Figurehead’s\nreputation within the military, as Figureheads\nnot only know how to “talk the talk,” but to\n“walk the walk” as well.\n[P]As many Figureheads got their start in the political\narenas of the Core Worlds, it’s no surprise that most of\nthem know a thing or two about where they’ve come\nfrom. Not only do they have extensive knowledge of\nCore World political systems—including those of the\nnow-defunct Republic—but they also have information\nabout which Core Worlds systems are more or less\nopposed to the Empire. Such information can be valuable\nwhen deciding which systems to approach for help\nor determining where a group of Rebels in a pinch might\nbe able to seek refuge.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 28 - Lead by Example[h4]","attributes":{"3539l9l3w8m5ikc1":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"7cj19u4t1s3szim4":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"jx0idg3xbjjqg08m":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"bxb5lmx4a2c59l3p":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"004g9pf1qhppfd6q":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"gss3np7sk5bttvt4":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Resolve","description":"When a character involuntarily suffers strain, he suffers 1 less strain per rank of Resolve to a minimum of 1.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 142 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 155 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"ejZU7F896gwzsEER","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Confidence","description":"May decrease difficulty of Discipline checks to avoid fear by 1 per rank of Confidence.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 133 - Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 144 - Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Page 141 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"2leaEwirkfKu5Ego","attributes":{}},"talent3":{"name":"Command","description":"Add [BO] per rank of Command when making Leadership checks.

Some parts might not even seem like valuable information at first. A Slicer may never uncover a minister's esoteric hobbies that could be used for blackmail. An Infiltrator might not recognize that an old plaque conceals a datachip loaded with secrets. Skilled Interrogators, however, can uncover secrets that their subjects might not even recognize they possess. Often, this requires that the subject be captured first, but some operatives are so skilled and subtle that they can extract secrets from targets through casual conversation without letting the targets realize what has happened. These specialists grant the Rebellion unexpected and unorthodox advantages that it needs to succeed against enormous odds.\n[P]Interrogators acquire [B]Charm, Coercion, Medicine,[b] and [B]Perception[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, the player may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each without spending starting experience.\n[P]In order to successfully question a target, an Interrogator needs to have some background info about the subject, possibly including personality traits, loved ones, and interests, in addition to knowing what type of information to seek. Personal history is critical to gaining leverage over a target. Interrogators must be versed in a range of information extraction techniques so that they can determine the best method for a particular foe. Physical coercion can work effectively against some enemies, but for others, psychological attacks are far more efficient. Recognizing the best technique and having the appropriate tools readily available makes each interrogation faster and the results more reliable.\n[P]A physically imposing questioner may rely upon violence, and this technique can sometimes be effective. However it is invariably cruel. Further, Imperial officers are trained to resist these techniques, reducing their efficacy. Additionally, some subjects recognize that the consequences for giving in to this type of torture can be as severe as those for resisting it. For these reasons, the most effective of interrogations eschew physical techniques for social ones.\n[P]Many Interrogators instead use a combination of Charm and Deception to effectively draw information from their subjects. They may intimidate through threats—often to the subject's friends, family, or special interests—rather than direct violence. Demonstrations of power over those other parties can provide additional leverage, though such demonstrations may be fabricated as necessary.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 26 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{"efsr05pwm6c98lj6":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"ae2moh61e0ocwsn9":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"yz9g2zfcv9c67wde":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"p2jyday0e7fkht3v":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"ki8q1rfipj6d7ioc":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"lw2jz5dnjo2wqhme":{"mod":"Medicine","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"azzhz3lqwqrr1jqd":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"j4w86kqzt1l5swft":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Intimidating","description":"May suffer a number of strain to downgrade difficulty of Coercion checks, or upgrade difficulty when targeted by Coercion checks, by an equal number.

{"name":"Heavy","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Heavy - Overwhelming Firepower[h4]\n\n[P]For a Heavy, size really does matter. These characters prefer to use the biggest guns possible, and usually have the physique to match. Heavies are often physically impressive, a necessity for effectively wielding the heaviest man-portable weapons. Heavies are inevitably found at the front in combat, as allies back away and give them space.\n\n[P]The list of additional career skills for a Heavy consists of [B]Gunnery, Perception, Ranged (Heavy),[b] and [B]Resilience[b]. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each, without spending starting experience. This straightforward list of skills allows a Heavy to do primarily one thing: wield large, dangerous weapons. From heavy blasters to missile tubes, Heavies favor big, loud, and devastating weaponry. Using such weapons is often punishing for the wielder, and characters must possess great fortitude in order to wield such weapons extensively. A high Resilience skill is often a side effect of the Heavy's actions, rather than the result of conscious training. Lugging around heavy weapons builds stamina, and simply dealing with the recoil provides a workout. \n\n[P]Heavies generally approach combat in the most direct way possible—stealth and duplicity are not becoming of a walking arsenal. Similarly, Heavies tend to be very straightforward in their dealings. This bluntness sometimes comes across as a lack of intellect, though few would be brave enough to say so to the Heavy's face. There may be some truth to the perception that Heavies sacrifice brains for brawn, but as with all generalizations, there are many exceptions. In a galaxy of double-crosses and altered deals, steadfastness and blunt honesty can be seen as virtues.\n\n[P]While some Heavies may work as independent operators, most find themselves as a permanent addition to a group. Heavies can easily find a place among a mercenary band. Having a Heavy in a group is a great boon. The mere sight of the heavy weapons they carry can ensure that no one hassles them, and a single Heavy—when properly equipped—is easily a match for numerous foes.\n\n[P]In a Player Character group, a Heavy fulfills a similar role to that of a light battle tank in a military force. Heavies can often deal out enough damage to wipe out entire groups of enemies single-handedly, and are also typically able to absorb a great deal of punishment.

When wielded forcefully, it can even overpower an opponent who has a weapon capable of parrying it. Further, its ability to deflect blaster bolts can make it an effective ranged weapon as well. Those who consider themselves Shien Experts—masters of the Shien lightsaber form—embrace the seeming contradiction between those two uses. They know that true lightsaber masters must possess the cunning to use such weapons to their full potential. It takes clever precision to reflect a ranged attack back toward an adversary. but just as much shrewd brilliance to recognize the right time to overpower adversaries through raw force.\n\n[P]Shien Experts acquire [B]Athletics, Lightsaber, Resilience,[b] and [B]Skulduggery[b] as additional career skills. If this is the characters starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills and gain one free rank in each. without spending starting experience. In order to effectively follow this path, a character needs to be flexible and to recognize the best approaches for different types of physical conflicts. Resilience and Athletics are critical tools for engaging in and enduring a prolonged battle, while  Skulduggery enables the character to case out and prepare possible combat locations ahead of time to exploit the environment against an opponent.\n\n[P]Whenever possible, a Shien Expert prepares a battleground well in advance of a conflict. Often, these individuals take the time to study a range of different locations soon after they arrive in a city. Once combat begins, they can carefully exploit the environment and trigger any traps they may have prepared to unleash upon their opponents.\n\n[P]During combat, Shien Experts continue to constantly analyze the situation. While they take advantage of the terrain throughout a battle, they are also selective in choosing the best way to use their training as well as their lightsaber. This can change with each passing instant, in reaction to the armament, position, and stance of their enemies. For these individuals, an extended conflict is a sure route to victory as they react to every move their opponents make with a clever counter or powerful strike.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 95 - Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"k5nv03tpvf1xthg8":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"cvjexrtp2wncezml":{"mod":"Athletics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"japszujzt4ln24fg":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"4eirbroa1nnady16":{"mod":"Lightsaber","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"9oz9izx4gdh59bpd":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"lqc05l1f55i3oyla":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"s5c1vkstoiw223cw":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"i7ha2evj2uqujxtc":{"mod":"Skulduggery","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Side Step","description":"Once per round, may perform Side Step maneuver and suffer a number of strain to upgrade difficulty of all incoming ranged attacks by an equal number for the next round.

At the end of the day, a few troops with blasters and bombs can disable any installation, disrupt an entire defensive grid, and create the conditions of victory. They do so under the courageous and savvy leadership of a Tactician.\n\n[P]The additional career skills for a Tactician are [B]Brawl, Discipline, Leadership,[b] and [B]Ranged (Heavy)[b]. Two of these four skills begin with a free rank if this is the first specialization chosen for the PC. Tacticians often insist on being able to fight even without weapons if called upon to do so, and many prefer heavier weapons for combat. Additionally, they are the ones who must be true leaders, even in the face of the worst possible odds.\n\n[P]When all is going well, a Tactician tends to be the person the rest of a team grouses about over too much work, monotonous duties, and repeated training. However, when the blaster fire is flying and people are screaming and dying all around, the team looks to the Tactician to lead them, whether it's out of danger or into glory. A Tactician assesses the situation at all times, looking for the best way to accomplish the mission and keep his people alive. His team depends on him for these skills.\n\n[P]By Alliance philosophy, Tacticians are made, not born. Battlefield promotions happen constantly, for Alliance ground forces suffer the greatest losses constantly. Those who show any capacity for leadership are brought up in rank rapidly when the need calls. Others are cultivated more fully for the most important and dangerous missions.

{"name":"Propagandist","type":"specialization","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H4]Propagandist - From a Certain Point of View[h4]\n\nTruth is often a matter of perspective, and Propagandists serve the Rebel Alliance by skewing this perspective in favor of their cause. To the Propagandist, truth is just as much worth pursuing as it is worth manipulating. Whether simply leaking the right facts to shift public opinion or creating outright fabrications to demoralize the enemy, a Propagandist understands the power of perception.\n\n[P]Propagandists gain [B]Charm, Deception, Knowledge (Warfare),[b] and [B]Perception[b] as additional career skills. If this is the character's starting specialization, he may choose two of these skills, gaining one free rank in each without spending starting experience. Propagandists leverage Perception to uncover the truth and use Charm or Deception to spin it to benefit the Rebel Alliance. Some Propagandists focus more on either weaving compelling rhetoric or telling believable lies, while others prefer to gain ranks in Charm and Deception equally, giving them maximum flexibility.\n\n[P]Propagandists play an important role in the Galactic Civil War. Even as the battles rage on and above many oppressed worlds, the Rebel Alliance wages an equally important struggle for the support of the galactic citizenry. While the Empire's evil is obvious to most, few possess the courage to stand against such a brutal enemy. Propagandists must sway these people, distributing persuasive information as far and wide as possible, inspiring heroism in everyday citizens.\n\n[P]Ideally, a Propagandist reveals truths that the Empire would conceal: galactic atrocities, corruption, and the terrible cost of its policies. However, few Propagandists deal strictly in truth as such, more likely distributing misinformation to enrage the oppressed. Criticizing the ethics of such tactics is difficult when they serve the cause so effectively. Propagandists might argue that small lies expose much greater truths that the Empire tries to conceal. For some, news is as much a business as a political pursuit, while for others, propaganda is of paramount importance.\n\n[P]In a group of Player Characters, a Propagandist can act as a master of information collection, interviewing civilians and even military personnel for rumors and secrets. Perhaps even more importantly, by planting information in the right ears, a skilled Propagandist can demoralize enemies, manipulating them into believing untruths. For this, a Propagandist is well served by a high Cunning and a high Presence.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 30 - Desperate Allies[h4]","attributes":{"x5st09mmoejiifo9":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"hpnwb3fde0eq9ei6":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"zqpv2sodsddcsef7":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"0zxx2d2kgmkky64y":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0},"6ve7z82gdlg5ldmc":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Career Skill","value":true},"q01ckis3el302yp0":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":0}},"talents":{"talent0":{"name":"Grit","description":"Gain +1 strain threshold","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"LtmejPqTTIGuj8GD","attributes":{"29vwke2mfltymmep":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":1}}},"talent1":{"name":"Positive Spin","description":"Whenever any character's Duty would increase, it increases by an additional 1 per rank of Positive Spin.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Desperate Allies[h4]","activation":"Passive","activationLabel":"SWFFG.TalentActivationsPassive","isForceTalent":false,"isConflictTalent":false,"isRanked":true,"size":"single","canLinkTop":true,"canLinkRight":true,"itemId":"zucY6UabO00DuV6M","attributes":{}},"talent2":{"name":"Inside Knowledge","description":"Once per session while in an enemy facility or vessel, may perform the Inside Knowledge action, make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Skulduggery check[b].
