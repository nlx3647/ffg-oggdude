Officially, the E-11 s carries a restricted rating, limiting it to governmental, military, and law-enforcement use only. That being said, more than a few of these powerful rifles have fallen out of the backs of speeder trucks, so to speak. Those that have found their way into civilian hands make for excellent hunting and sniping weapons, and their performance nearly makes up for the serious risks involved in owning them. \n\n[P]E-11s rifles are equipped with relatively light-weight, matte-finish composite furniture that absorbs light, a fixed stock, and a powerful multioptical telescopic sight. The rifle's firing mechanism uses a supercharged actuating module, upgraded exciter, and extremely volatile, highly compressed blaster gasses to increase the range and penetration of the blaster bolt. This extra power has the added side effect of reducing refraction and beam degradation, allowing it to maintain both its penetration and stopping power at incredible range. While this makes for a powerful weapon, especially in the hands of a talented marksman, it also makes for a weapon that consumes quite a bit of energy and as such has a limited ammunition capacity (a rarity in blasters). These rifles also emit an enormous amount of heat when firing, thanks to their supercharged firing systems. To compensate for this, the E-11 s has a slow rate of fire to allow for cool-down, and the barrel is insulated with a triple-redundant nitrogen cooling system.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":3500,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":7,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":true},"hardpoints":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"8iSDMh1U3HQD0563","name":"Accurate Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether through design or technology.

A large, intimidating weapon, the BR-219 has a short, thick barrel with a broad aperture, a heavy-duty frame, and a custom grip with an integral recoil compensation system. These super-heavy pistols were developed in response to requests from bounty hunters and law enforcement agencies for a powerful, pistol-sized weapon for use in taking down particularly dangerous opponents. To meet the demand, BlasTech turned to one of its most popular and well-respected product lines and developed the BR-219 from its E-11 series of millitary blaster rifles.\n[P]Using the E-11's reciever and firing mechanism, BlasTech engineers then reengineered the XCiter and actuating module to produce an overcharged bolt, equipped the drastically shortened barrel with an improved Galven pattern, and developed a special and highly volatile blend of blaster gases to feed their new weapon. All of this enhanced technology combined with the new bespoke blaster gas made for an extremely powerful—if slightly inaccurate and finicky—pistol. The bolt from the BR-219 is nearly as powerful as the E-11, and the weapon produces a tremendous noise and muzzle flash when fired. It is neither a subtle nor a restrained weapon; openly carrying one of these massive pistols makes an eloquent point about the user's intentions.\n[P]The BR-219 is not sold through BlasTech's usual dealer network. Instead, the weapon must be custom ordered straight from the factory. A thorough Imperial Security Bureau background check and a specially issued carry permit are required to purchase one of these weapons legally. Of course, this background check can be circumvented by purchasing the pistol on the black market or acuiring it through other less-than-legal means. Carrying a BR-219 without the proper permit is a risky business, and being found with an illegally purchased model is grounds for immediate Imperial imprisonment. Using a BR-219 in combat for an extended period of time is,  to the least, quite hazardous. The immense heat generated by the high-performance blaster gas and the overcharged action of the firing mechanism put an incredible amount of strain on the weapon.\n[P]GMs may spend [TH][TH] from a check to cause the BR-219 to become damaged one step (undamaged to minot, minor to moderate, etc.) and suffer the penalties listed on page 166 of the [B]Force and Destiny[b] Core Rulebook until repaired.

The staff might be tall and spry, or gnarled and bent. A Revered Master might fashion it from a single branch, once gifted to them by a Tholothian dignitary. What united these tools was their connection to Lasat mysticism. Among other qualities, they gave strength to Revered Masters during particularly grueling rituals.\n[P]These vibrant cultural expressions have become rare under the Empire.

When activated, a full-sized lightsaber blade springs from each emitter, making an exceptionally potent weapon nearly as long as a full-grown human. The weapon's twin blades allow a user to strike more rapidly, and sometimes fight multiple foes at once.

Because blasters require such infrequent reloading in the first place, this feature proved to be of secondary concern to most buyers, who were put off by the weapon's extra weight in comparison to similarly sized carbines. As a result, the OK-98 sold poorly and SoroSuub discontinued production of the model after only six years.

Even those Core Worlds with the most draconian restrictions on weapon ownership have no official laws governing air-powered weapons. A specialized form of slugthrower, air rifles use compressed air or other gasses to propel tiny metal pellets or light, spin-stabilized darts over long distances. Lightweight and extremely accurate, they are usually marketed to hobby shooters, collectors, or those who need a quiet, easy-to-use, and relatively safe weapon with which to practice their marksmanship. \n\n[P]These weapons' balance, accuracy, portability, and the nearly complete silence of their firing mechanism make them excellent weapons for hunters, both of beasts and of sentient beings. Combined with the ability to chamber specialty darts that can be filled with various chemicals and toxins, air weapons make for fine silent killing weapons. \n\n[P]One of the most common air rifles on the market is the Model 77 from Field Sports, a trusted name in air-weapon production. Known colloquially as the Sandman, thanks to the unique effects of its standard ammunition, the Model 77 is a lightweight, long-barreled air gun similar in silhouette and stature to a sporting blaster. Made primarily of polycarbonate with fibermesh reinforcement, the Model 77 was initially marketed as a nonlethal weapon for animal control and law enforcement. It fires tiny, spin-stabilized darts with laser-honed tips capable of piercing the thickest hide from a detachable clip that is quick and easy to reload. Each dart contains a dose of tranquilizer agent that induces unconsciousness. In addition, the Model 77's darts can be loaded with the heavy-duty \"SmartTranq\" tranquilizer with an active ingredient that adapts itself upon contact with the target's bloodstream to be as effective as possible no matter what the species. Sandman air rifles have a well-deserved reputation for accuracy and reliability.

Most fire proton-charged warheads designed to destroy small transports, but other types of ammunition can occasionally be found. \n\n[P]Missile tubes are elaborate affairs, equipped with micro-repulsorlifts that make them easier for infantry soldiers to carry, as well as advanced tracking screens to detect a target's speed, range, and energy signature. The latter is particularly important because missile tubes can be fired in one of three modes. The first is infrared, which homes in on a craft's heat signature. The second is gravity-activated mode, which means it tracks a target's repulsorlift. Both of these modes can be spoofed, either by dropping burning flares to distract heat sensors or small repulsorlift pods as chaff. See the Guided weapon quality to handle these two modes of attack. \n\n[P]The third firing method is direct-fire. This requires more skill but sends the projectile in a straight line that cannot be spoofed by chaff or flares (and loses the Guided quality). Of course, if another target happens to get in the way, or if the attacker's aim is off, the missile will hit whatever is in its path without discrimination.

The weapon's firing mechanism is a slightly detuned version of Merr-Sonn's military-grade blaster system giving the rifle pinpoint accuracy and an incredible punch at extreme range. The LD-1 is also equipped with a Mk. 19 computer-aided macroscope with various optical enchancements and an Autosteady gyro-gimbal system to increase the weapon's performance at long and extreme ranges. It is easily disassembled and is sold with a custom-fit carrying case for transporting the rifle around in a relatively discreet fashion.\n[P]Since its introduction, the LD-1 has become wildly popular. Its performance, power, and build quality are nearly unmatched in its segment. These qualities—combined with its official classification as a sporting blaster, which allows it to circumvent most weapon restrictions in the galaxy—have driven the LD-1 to consistently outsell the older SoroSuub X-45. In addition, aggressive marketing by Merr-Sonn and regular appearances on a popular HoloNet adventure drama proggram have established the LD-1 firmly in both military and popular culture.\n[P]It is rumored that a variant called the LD-1a is produced in small numbers for the Imperial Security Bureau.

{"name":"Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle","type":"weapon","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/weapons/WeaponMODEL38.png","data":{"description":"[H3]Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle[h3]\n\nFor millennia, Czerka Arms has maintained a reputation as a purveyor of fine arms and armor for both the military and civilian markets. While they have an impressive and diversified catalog of offensive and defensive products ranging from sporting blasters and vibroblades to flame cannons and combat droids, they are perhaps best known for producing a successful line of fine slugthrowing pistols and rifles. \n\n[P]A throwback to a more primitive age, slugthrowers are considered anachronistic and unwieldy by most sentients. However, Czerka's line of slugthrowers, which they refer to as \"Legacy Arms,\" has proven modestly successful, especially among the beings of the Outer Rim. Some of their Legacy Arms clients are collectors or historians, others are farmers or colonists who appreciate the affordability and ruggedness of these firearms, and some simply prefer the visceral noise and flash of a chemical-propelled slug over the cool precision of a blaster. Whatever their reasons, whether preference or necessity, Czerka is the popular choice for slugthrowers. \n\n[P]One of Czerka's more popular Legacy Arms is the Model 38 Sharpshooter's Rifle. Marketed to hunters, and tacitly to snipers and assassins, the Model 38 is an extremely powerful, accurate, long-range rifle with incredible destructive potential. A long and finely crafted weapon, each Model 38 is custom built to the customer's specifications. It chambers a powerful, large-caliber round with a specially coated penetrating bullet that can pierce even the toughest hides. The rifle is operated by means of a simple and rugged bolt action and fed by a five-round detachable clip. Their stocks and other furniture are typically either light-weight composites or polished, exotic hardwoods, depending on the customer's tastes. \n\n[P]New rifles must be ordered in person from a certified Czerka Arms dealer, at which time the customer is measured for fit and his shooting style is analyzed in an on-site simulator. This allows the Czerka Arms rep to determine the best possible configuration for the rifle in relation to its new owner and to offer advice on further customization. \n\n[P]Once the rifle is completed and delivered, it is as closely matched to the new shooter's stance, stature, and habits as art and artifice can make it. This makes the rifles incredibly accurate at any range, as the custom fit and frame makes the Model 38 point and shoot as if it were an extension of the shooter's body. Most Model 38 rifles in the Outer Rim are owned by hunters and marksmen for hire who ordered them directly from Czerka. There are some of these highly prized rifles on the used market, although they typically need serious modification before a new owner can use them to their full potential. If purchased used, a Czerka Model 38 loses the Accurate 2 quality until the rifle can be modified to fit the new shooter (requiring a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b]).[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":5,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":3000,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"hardpoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"8iSDMh1U3HQD0563","name":"Accurate Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"Accurate weapons are easier to aim or wield, whether through design or technology.

They feature an integrated gyroscopic balancing system that assists in balance and handling, a multi-optic telescopic sighl that allows a shooter to target prey in nearly all conditions, and a charge setting that trades the weapon's ammunition capacity for a single, devastating blast. Despite the fact that the MR-90 is marketed as an upscale hunting rifle for aristocratic adventurers, many military and paramilitary forces throughout the galaxy have adopted it as a dedicated anti-materiel weapon and high-powered sniper rifle.\n[P]As a maneuver, a character using an MR-90 can set the weapon to its charge setting, which allows the shooter to expend all of the rifle's energy in a single, devastating blast.

Lighter and shorter than its full-sized cousin, the E5 was released in the beginning months of the Clone Wars and saw wide use among vehicle crews and special operatives of the Confederacy of Independent Systems. This weapon was also issued to B1 battle droids, and is the weapon with which those droids are most associated. Like its larger cousin the E-5 blaster rifle, the E5 carbine was based on an earlier BlasTech design which was reverse-engineered by weaponsmiths at Baktoid Armor Workshop for use with their 00M, B1, and BX series droids. It's a relatively reliable blaster that provides respectable stopping power in a small, easy-to-handle package. In addition to its lightened frame and shortened barrel, the E5 also features a foldable stock that further increases its usability. As they were largely designed for use by droids, vehicle crews, and rear-echelon troops, E5 carbines suffer from a few noticeable drawbacks. They are relatively inaccurate over long distances, and thanks to cost-cutting during development, many of their systems are built of substandard materials, making them comparatively fragile and prone to overheating during heavy use. While not particularly liked or well-respected weapons, E5 carbines are cheap and readily available, having been built by the hundreds of thousands during the Clone Wars. This makes them very attractive to more cash-strapped members of the Rebel Alliance. \n\n[P]During combat, the Game Master can spend [TH][TH][TH] or [DE] to force an E5 to overheat, damaging it by one step as if stuck by a weapon with the Sunder quality (see page 170 of the [B]Age of Rebellion[b] Core Rulebook).[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":550,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"hardpoints":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"Jh0zKi5IYmo6eqx9","name":"Stun Setting Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"Some weapons deal Stun damage instead of regular damage.

Much smaller and lighter than anti-vehicle mines, one or two anti-personnel mines can easily be carried by a single trooper. They are usually deployed with their larger cousins around fortifications and on the battlefield to protect assets or disrupt enemy troop movement, or as part of booby traps or sabotage. The major drawback to anti-personnel mines is, much like flame projectors and thermal detonators, they can inadvertently target allies. In addition, the production and use of these weapons is banned on many worlds due to the fact that unexploded mines can remain active and ready to kill on battlefields well after the fighting is over. \n\n[BR][B]Models Include:[b] Merr-Sonn LX-1 Laser Flechette Mine, Merr-Sonn SM-01 High Explosive Land Mine.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":3,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":850,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":true},"hardpoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"tgAhC4L1QPCVAswN","name":"Blast Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or similar area of effect, like the detonation of a grenade or a warhead fired from a missile launcher.

Worn strapped to an officer's non-dominant forearm, a riot shield averages around a meter long and nearly as wide, providing almost complete cover for a kneeling or crouching officer. They are constructed from a variety of materials. The shields are typically shaped in such a way as to help deflect incoming thrown objects and stand up to sustained fire from nearly any sidearm, although anything more powerful than a heavy blaster makes short work of a riot shield and the officer behind it. In addition to their obvious protective qualities, riot shields can be used as improvised, somewhat awkward melee weapons, allowing an officer to push and bash his way through a crowd if need be. \n\n[P]Riot shields require one hand to wield, and so can only be used with pistols and one-handed melee weapons. Some riot shields incorporate a slot or mag-lock to allow the user to support a Ranged (Heavy) weapon with the shield itself (firing the weapon one-handed while wielding the riot shield in the other hand). A riot shield with this feature costs an additional 100 credits and has no hard points.

This bulky, box-shaped launcher holds four canister tubes, and can fire either anti-personnel or anti-vehicle flechettes. The weapon fires small missiles designed to detonate close to their target, then shred it with numerous durasteel darts. The standard anti-infantry canister releases hundreds of small flechettes over a wide area, ideal for taking down groups of enemies. Anti-vehicle rounds feature a much smaller number, usually fewer than a dozen, of significantly larger and heavier darts capable of shearing straight through ten centimeters of durasteel plating. The shaped charge of an anti-vehicle cartridge focuses the projectiles over a much smaller area, and is ideal for bringing down repulsorcraft or other light vehicles (especially since the armor-penetrating darts tend to slice through the thick outer armor then bounce around inside the hull, tearing up vital components). \n\n[P]Before firing the FC1, the firer must use the scope's built-in range finder to program a detonation range approximately 10 meters in front of the target for ideal dispersal of flechettes. This guarantees he hits the target with the blast. The anti-vehicle rounds of a flechette launcher have a much narrower spread, making them highly inaccurate against small targets. When used against targets of silhouette 1 or smaller and firing anti-vehicle rounds, the weapon gains the Inaccurate 3 quality. \n\n[P]An FC1 may be loaded with anti-personnel or anti-vehicle rounds, and can fire a total of four shots. Some mercenaries tend to load the FC1 with a mix of both, so that they can respond to any situation.

A rarity even among the already scarce slugthrowing class of weapons, the KS-23 fires a canister of small explosive pellets instead of a single long-range, precision slug. When fired, these pellets scatter from the barrel to fill a wide area with as much destructive potential as possible. Brutally effective at short and medium ranges, this weapon is known unofficially as the \"Hammer.\" \n\n[P]The KS-23 was initially produced as a hunting weapon to take down extremely hardy beasts like the krayt dragon or rancor. They are roughly the size of a blaster carbine, with a large-caliber smoothbore barrel, a sturdy action, and composite stocks and furniture. The ammunition is stored in a tubular, five-round magazine that runs under the barrel, and the firing mechanism is self-loading and uses the weapon's recoil for power. An extremely unsubtle weapon, the KS-23 is loud and has a powerful recoil thanks to the large-bore, high-powered ammunition it fires. \n\n[P]Thanks to its rugged construction and powerful ammunition, the KS-23 has gained a wide following in the Outer Rim. Easy to maintain and repair and built from high-quality, resilient materials, the Hammer stands up exceedingly well to the kinds of abuse equipment suffers in the wild places of the galaxy.

Xenoarchaeologists even theorize the Blood Monarchy grew from ritual hunts of these creatures. Extinct in modern times, the beast's brutality left a lasting impression on Thisspias. For centuries, engineers sought to emulate its defensive plating and toxic spines.\n[P]In keeping with this motif, ancient warrior-sages created weapons in the beast's image. Their blend of metalwork and the Force even parallels that of modern alchemists. For 250 years, poisoned ystervark spears were the Royal Guard's most iconic weapon. As the Blood Monarchy's public influence fell, so too did the ystervark's. While Thisspiasians still respect both, the call for such weapons has diminished. Before the rise of the Empire, only the Quillbomb retained its mass appeal.\n[P]The device is not much larger than a closed fist, and wicked-looking spines litter its surface. On detonation, these spines rip through armor, burrowing deep into flesh. Each spine carries a dose of synthetic toxin, inspired by the ancient ystervark's venom. With its weak payload, the bomb is less focused on raw explosive power. Rather, it relies on driving at least one spine intact into a victim's body. The contagions used are often as quick as they are debilitating. One spine is enough to immediately impair motor functions. Any more will cause excruciating pain.\n[P]With the Blood Monarchy outlawed by the Empire, the Quillbomb is taking on a new life as a symbol of resistance. Rebels searching for urban weaponry have revitalized the production of these ancient weapons. The bombs are harder to detect than conventional explosives, perfect for saboteurs. Storm troopers are beginning to dread missions to quash Thisspiasian resistance. Once the subject of mockery, the Quillbomb's body count continues to rise. True to form, the bomb has damaged both body and mind of the Imperial war machine.

Nearly the size of a blaster carbine, and sharing a number of parts and systems with the Clone Wars-era DC-15 blaster carbine, the HH-50 is the largest, heaviest, highest-output blaster pistol currently produced by BlasTech. Popular with beast riders, vehicle crews, and cavalry scouts, the HH-50 packs a blaster rifle's worth of stopping power into a relatively small and easy to use package. Using a patented dual-circuit galven pattern, an overcharged X-citer, and a powerful mix of blaster gases, the HH-50 fires both barrels with one pull of the trigger, allowing it to pierce the thickest hide. The downside to all of this stopping power is that the HH-50 is incredibly inefficient, even for a heavy blaster pistol, and tends to run its blaster gas chamber dry at the most inopportune times. \n\n[P]During combat, Game Masters may make an HH-50 run out of ammunition by spending [TH][TH].

Unlike a typical heavy repeating blaster that is stationary and requires a team of three dedicated gunners, the MWC-35c was designed to be easily portable and require less training for use. The weapon consists of a backpack-mounted, high-output energy generator connected to a blunt nosed heavy blaster rifle by way of an armored galven-circuitry flexible charge belt. While it is heavy and bulky, the generator's straps work like load-bearing gear to distribute the weight around the wearer's body to make it relatively easier to carry.\n[P]While the MWC-35c works surprisingly well, it has some drawbacks. The armored cable that carries power from the backpack to the rifle can break or become disconnected during heavy use, making the weapon useless until repaired. The generator itself, although well protected, can detonate when ruptured, often killing the wearer and seriously wounding anyone nearby.\n[P]The repeating cannon can be fired in two different modes.

Simple and reliable, the PB08 is a sturdy, large framed blaster pistol with a short ventilated barrel that delivers excellent damage and penetration over short ranges. What makes the PB08 stand out from the crowd is its heat management and energy conservation systems. Most heavy blaster pistols, especially the DL-44, have a nasty tendency to overheat or run out of blaster gas at the most inopportune times. Merr-Sonn's designers eliminated these drawbacks from the PB08 by using gas circulation heat sinks in the barrel to dissipate the heat generated by the powerful blaster bolts. These pistols also have a unique energy management system designed to squeeze as much energy out of Tibanna gas as possible. While this makes the PB08 more reliable, it also reduces the weapon's range and raw damage output.\n[P]This weapon cannot be made to run out of ammo by spending [DE].[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 118 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]<div>This weapon cannot be made to run out of ammo by spending [DE] </div>","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":800,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"hardpoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[null,{"_id":"Jh0zKi5IYmo6eqx9","name":"Stun Setting Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"Some weapons deal Stun damage instead of regular damage.

VIII Vibrosaw[h3]\n\nCreel Wood Logging Corporation is a small, privately owned logging concern founded solely for the harvesting the of the highly sought-after Greel trees from the third and fourth planets of the PH System. Greels are hardy, ancient trees that produce an extremely dense, deep-crimson hardwood. Thanks to the resilience of the trees and the difficulty of harvesting them, GWLC developed special tools to aid in logging and processing. Working closely with a number of precision industrial toolmakers from the Corporate Sector, GWLC produced a line of saws, heavy equipment, specialized heavy-lift speedertrucks, and other assorted logging machinery for their personal use, and eventually they sold them to the general public. Marketed mainly to industrial logging concerns, many of these tools are also used in the surveying and exploration of newly discovered planets, especially those with dense and thorny flora. One of the more common GWLC tools is the Mk. VIII Vibrosaw. \n\n[P]Loud and extremely challenging to use, the Mk. VIII is a heavy vibrosaw that can cut through the toughest undergrowth or fell the tallest trees. They are heavy, awkward brutes that, in the hands of the inexperienced or inattentive, can cause more damage to the user than to the surrounding flora. The Mk. VIII consists of a blocky chassis containing the saw's controls, two SureGrip handles, a power pack, a drive motor, and a vibrofield generator. The blade mounted to the front of the chassis is long and thin, ringed by a rotating, high-speed, diamond-toothed chain whose already impressive cutting ability is further augmented by a powerful vibrofield. Although not designed as such, the Mk. VIII can be used as a weapon in an emergency, its blade slicing through flesh and bone as easily as root and branch. Caution must be used when doing so, however, as even the slightest miscalculation or misstep can result in the user receiving gruesome injuries from his own saw.\n\n[P]If the user generates [DE] when using the Mk.

Roughly hald as long as a grown human is tall, the FS19 uses a system of pulleys and cams to increase an archer's leverage and strength, therefore producing a more powerful and efficent weapon in a small easy-to-use package.

Over two meters long, the Huntsman is a sturdy vibrospear designed for hunting large and dangerous wild game. Equipped with LaserHone's patented ultrasonic vibrotechnology, the vibrogenerator in the Huntsman vibrates at frequencies well outside the hearing range of most sentients. The ultrasonic vibrogenerator, special dampening fittings, and a coating of sound-absorbing polymers make the Huntsman completely silent when active. This allows a hunter to carry a powerful vibroweapon in the field without the fear of spooking his prey with the noise from the weapon. \n\n[P]The Huntsman's haft is a super-dense plasteel alloy embedded with sound-deadening materials and laced with foil-fiber reinforcements. Incredibly strong and flexible, the Huntsman can parry nearly any incoming blow, from the claws of a powerful beast to the slashing edge of a vibro-ax. The blade is a long, thin, leaf-shaped affair made from a laser-honed steel alloy with a molecular edge that can pass through steel and stone as easy as through flesh and muscle. At the base of the blade where it meets the haft, two thick posts extend for a few centimeters perpendicular to the haft to prevent particularly recalcitrant beasts from charging up the haft after being stabbed and attacking the spear's wielder. While it is more of a niche weapon with limited appeal, many professional scouts and hunters appreciate the deadly simplicity of the Huntsman and the challenge of hunting untamed beasts in ways similar to their ancient forebears. \n\n[P]The vibrospear requires two hands to wield.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{"86wb4uyhdz3jwxce":{"isCheckbox":false,"mod":"damage","modtype":"Weapon Stat","value":3}},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":4,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":950,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"hardpoints":{"value":2,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"zFzCvB6bUqEr4deZ","name":"Pierce Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"An attack made with this weapon ignores one point of soak for each rank of Pierce.

Possessing low-intensity blast-actuating modulators and using a lower yield mix of blast gasses than other, more lethal blaster rifles, stun rifles are capable of only nonlethal stunning blasts. Most of these weapons are used in law enforcement, corrections, and occasionally in bounty hunting, fields in which the need to keep targets alive is often of paramount importance. They are typically short ranged, and their bolts have a broad spread to catch as many targets in their blast as possible. While this is effective in close quarters or in large crowds, in open terrain their effectiveness is sadly reduced. To counter this, and to corner the market in long-range stun blasters, BlasTech recently released the all-new LBR-9 Stun Rifle. \n\n[P]Based on the current model DL-87 Firespray stun rifle, the LBR-9 is a long-barreled, light-framed blaster rifle fitted with composite furniture and simple iron sights. Using the majority of the Firespray's firing system with an upgraded galven pattern designed to fit the longer barrel, the LBR-9 can fire a concentrated, high-penetration stun bolt with a range and accuracy commensurate with other, more lethal weapons in its class. With its optimized and upgraded galven pattern and a patented mix of blaster gasses, the LBR-9 packs quite a punch and typically needs only one or two shots to knock a target out of commission. Only recently brought to market and largely sold to Core Systems' planetary law-enforcement agencies, few of these specialized weapons have found their way to the fringes of civilized space.

This bulky, box-shaped launcher holds four canister tubes, and can fire either anti-personnel or anti-vehicle flechettes. The weapon fires small missiles designed to detonate close to their target, then shred it with numerous durasteel darts. The standard anti-infantry canister releases hundreds of small flechettes over a wide area, ideal for taking down groups of enemies. Anti-vehicle rounds feature a much smaller number, usually fewer than a dozen, of significantly larger and heavier darts capable of shearing straight through ten centimeters of durasteel plating. The shaped charge of an anti-vehicle cartridge focuses the projectiles over a much smaller area, and is ideal for bringing down repulsorcraft or other light vehicles (especially since the armor-penetrating darts tend to slice through the thick outer armor then bounce around inside the hull, tearing up vital components). \n\n[P]Before firing the FC1, the firer must use the scope's built-in range finder to program a detonation range approximately 10 meters in front of the target for ideal dispersal of flechettes. This guarantees he hits the target with the blast. The anti-vehicle rounds of a flechette launcher have a much narrower spread, making them highly inaccurate against small targets. When used against targets of silhouette 1 or smaller and firing anti-vehicle rounds, the weapon gains the Inaccurate 3 quality. \n\n[P]An FC1 may be loaded with anti-personnel or anti-vehicle rounds, and can fire a total of four shots.

Designed to give an infantry squad unparalleled automatic fire capacity, the aptly nicknamed \"Staccato Lightning\" delivers all the power of a heavy repeating blaster in a relatively compact, easy to use package. Unlike a typical heavy repeating blaster that is stationary and requires a team of three dedicated gunners, the MWC-35c was designed to be easily portable and require less training for use. The weapon consists of a backpack-mounted, high-output energy generator connected to a blunt nosed heavy blaster rifle by way of an armored galven-circuitry flexible charge belt. While it is heavy and bulky, the generator's straps work like load-bearing gear to distribute the weight around the wearer's body to make it relatively easier to carry.\n[P]While the MWC-35c works surprisingly well, it has some drawbacks. The armored cable that carries power from the backpack to the rifle can break or become disconnected during heavy use, making the weapon useless until repaired. The generator itself, although well protected, can detonate when ruptured, often killing the wearer and seriously wounding anyone nearby.\n[P]The repeating cannon can be fired in two different modes. The standard mode fires in a full-automatic surge designed to eliminate many targets in an instant. The secondary mode fires single-shot blasts of a higher power, but requires priming the weapon vie the pump-action foreguard.

Roughly the size of a thermal detonator, the G-20 is a small metallic sphere covered in spray nozzles. As a trigger, glop grenades are equipped with a timer that can be set to detonate on contact or set to detonate after a delay of up to fifteen seconds. Inside the sphere is a refillable reservoir that holds a semiliquid foam that instantly hardens upon contact with oxygen. When deployed, the user sets his detonation time and simply throws it at his target. When it detonates, the grenade sprays its quick-hardening foam over a broad area, trapping everything in its range in a thick, nearly unbreakable substance that is almost as strong as ferrocrete. The hardened foam is only good for around five minutes, after which it begins to break down and becomes brittle and easy to shatter.\n\n[P]A glop grenade's Ensnare quality triggers automatically on any targets the weapon hits, with no need to spend [AD]. \n\n[P]While glop grenades are ostensibly rated as nonlethal, accidents do happen, and they have been known to cause death due to suffocation or, in extremely rare cases, allergic reactions to the foam. Whenever a target is hit with a glop grenade, he must make an [B]Easy ([DI]) Coordination check[b] to keep the foam from filling his breathing passages.

Failure on the check indicates that the foam has been ruined, and any net [TH] gained on a failed skill check means that some mishap with the filling system occurs and the user is engulfed in quickly hardening goo.

Some Imperials also know it as a source of Rebel activity. But for generations of Jedi, the planet was known for its hidden temple, which safeguarded a Force-shrouded source of the kyber crystals utilized in lightsaber construction.\n[P]Hidden deep within the temple are the remains of the Ro- dian Jedi Lodaka. An unparalleled master of the third form of lightsaber dueling, Soresu, the Rodian was unusual among Jedi for also spending much of her time mastering a discipline not often thought of in conjunction with the order: physics. Specifically, Lodaka was fascinated by the material properties of the various crystals used in lightsaber construction, and she took a disciplined, reasoned approach to their study. A true scientist, she made careful, controlled experiments with many forms of crystals, both natural and manufactured, concentrating her efforts on modifications in the form of chemical coatings. She theorized that the effects of the different forms of crystals used in lightsabers could be enhanced by manipulating the crystalline structure of the base crystal. Although she used modern grav-field projectors and micromanipulators to conduct her experiments, it is thought she only achieved success when she manipulated the crystals on a molecular level using the Force.\n[P]All of Lodaka’s notes and papers were either destroyed or taken when the Jedi Temple on Coruscant was overrun following the implementation of Order 66. Only one of the crystals she modified is thought to still exist, and it is the one in her own lightsaber, which remains with her body on Lothal. It represented Lodaka’s finest work, as the particular modification she applied at least partially addressed a problem that had vexed lightsaber wielders for thousands of years.\n[P]Master Lodaka’s Lightsaber is a weapon with the following profile: (Lightsaber; Damage 10; Critical 1; Range [Engaged]; Breach 1, Sunder, Vicious 2).\n[P]Master Lodaka’s Lightsaber has an encumbrance of 1 and zero hard points.

Used as both anti-armor and anti-materiel weapons, most AP grenades use precisely calibrated shaped charges housed in specially designed casings to focus all of their explosive force on one small area. This allows them to be deployed against armored vehicles or structures with little collateral damage to the surrounding area. Despite their tightly focused area of effect, AP grenades still have a decent blast area. One or two tossed into a squad of Imperial stormtroopers or other soldiers in heavy armor can cause more damage than a whole handful of frag grenades. \n\n[P]Many AP grenades, especially those designed specifically for anti-armor and anti-materiel work, are equipped with either a magnetic or chemical adhesive system that allows them to be placed on walls, floors, and vehicle hulls for pinpoint demolitions and targeted sabotage. \n\n[P]Like frag grenades, AP grenades can be set to detonate on impact, set with a timer to detonate up to 3 rounds after being activated, or use a pressure detonator. \n\n[BR][B]Models Include:[b] Merr-Sonn Model 9 Armor Piercing Grenade, Merr-Sonn \"Door Buster\" Anti-Materiel Grenade.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":100,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"hardpoints":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Hard Points","abrev":"HP","adjusted":0},"equippable":{"value":true,"type":"Boolean","equipped":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"tgAhC4L1QPCVAswN","name":"Blast Quality","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-weapon.png","data":{"description":"The weapon has a large spread, an explosive blast, or similar area of effect, like the detonation of a grenade or a warhead fired from a missile launcher.
