{"name":"Quarren","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/QUARREN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Quarren[h4]\n\nPersistent and proud, the Quarren are deep-sea dwellers of the oceanic planet Mon Cala, or \"Dac\" as it is called in the native Quarren tongue. The distrusting and often paranoid nature of these stubborn aquatic humanoids makes them successful in a wide range of business, political, and underworld professions. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Quarren are a sinewy, humanoid species descended from cephalopods, with triangular heads and four tentacles protruding from their faces. A trio of sharp fangs lines their tiny mouths and works in concert with their prehensile face tentacles to communicate and feed. Above the cluster of tentacles is a pair of luminous blue or turquoise eyes that other species find intense. This unusual appearance has led to members of many other species referring to them by the derogatory term \"squid-faces.\" \n\n[P]Most Quarren possess lithe frames of toned muscle used to navigate their ocean homeworld with ease. Their leathery skin usually presents in subtle variations of pinkish-orange, but some Quarren are a mottled brown or gray-green. Quarren with pink- or purple skin are extremely rare and considered wildly beautiful among their species. The average Quarren has five sucker-tipped fingers on each hand, but some individuals exist with claws instead of suction cups. Still others have only three fingers with suckers or claws. While Quarren are amphibious, they are natural swimmers and are more comfortable breathing underwater. \n\n[P]Quarren exemplify resilience, not only in physique but in temperament. Proud to the point of stubbornness, Quarren prefer to adhere to tradition and often reject unnecessary change at all costs. Quarren are cautious and pessimistic, so their culture progresses only through absolute necessity and methodical planning. This tenacity often leads them to distrust idealistic cultures, creating tension between their species and the Mon Calamari with whom they share their world. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] For untold ages, the Quarren maintained a peaceful existence at the bottom of the sea on their homeworld of Dac, sometimes interacting with other sentient beings of their world, such as the hive-minded jelly Moappa and the enormous marine mammals, the Whaladons. Their tribal society upheld the traditional ways of their ancestors, mining abundant mineral lodes from Dac's underwater mountains and spear-fishing off the coast of small island chains tc support their modest civilization. All ni changed when ,Ph: Quarren made first contact with Dac's other sentient bipeds, the Mon Calamari. The Quarren's conservative and sometimes cynical nature stood in stark contrast to the Mon Calamari's tendencies toward creativity, idealism, and optimism. The culture clash between the two societies proved too much for the Quarren to bear. The antagonistic and territorial Quarren declared war on the Mon Calamari. \n\n[P]The brutal and prolonged conflict between the two civilizations ended in the near extermination of the Quarren species. In the wake of their victory, many Mon Calamari attempted to promote peaceful coexistence between the two species, although their societies were largely isolated—the Mon Calamari in their floating cities, and the Quarren in their cities and mining outposts on the seafloor. Deep rifts between the two species remained, the Quarren embittered by their defeat and what they saw as attempts to erase their culture, and the Mon Calamari frustrated by the failure of diplomacy. Tensions boiled over into open conflicts from time to time, although there were also periods of relative peace and cooperation. The Empire's arrival on Mon Cala has been yet another stumbling block for reconciliation between the two species. \n\n[P]Despite their lack of involvement in the fight against the Empire, the Quarren shared the Mon Calamari's fate for resisting Imperial reign and now live in slavery. For two decades, the Quarren mined valuable resources in labor camps to feed the ravenous Imperial military-industrial complex. Some Quarren fled their oceanic homeworld to escape the Empire's stranglehold, while others sought refuge undersea in hidden grottos and forgotten mining outposts. \n\n[P]Because of the oppression of Mon Cala, many Quarren resist the Empire's rule, while others work alongside it for their own personal gain. Such matters fall to the individual to decide, but the choice to resist the Empire or collaborate is one of extreme consequence to many Quarren. Fighting the Empire means risking one's life for the cause, but working alongside it means sacrificing innocent lives to maintain the Empire's brutal regime.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Quarren are native to the murky ocean depths of Dac, often called Mon Cala. The Outer Rim world is the last stop along the Overic Grip-link beyond the Tion Cluster, and it has been a major exporter of luxury star cruisers for millennia. A vast, planet-wide ocean covers Dac's surface, with only a handful of islands and coral reefs breaking the waves. Dac supports a thriving marine ecosystem, and the Quarren share their world with several other sentient species such as the cetacean Whaladons and the idealistic Mon Calamari. \n\n[P]Immense cities and other population centers both float atop and beneath the seas of Dac. Mon Calamari City, nicknamed \"Coral Depths City\" by some for its abundance of beautiful multi-colored coral gardens, has districts above and below the surface. It serves as the planet's seat of government. Other floating metropolises like Foamwander, Heurkea, Hikahi, Kee-Piru, Orotoru G'am, and Reef Home drift around the ocean world, each with their own unique architectural designs. Aquarius and other enormous domed cities and mining colonies exist beneath the waves where Mon Calamari, Quarren, and Whaladons live and work together. Even cultural centers like the community of intelligent mollusks known as the Knowledge Bank lie nestled between underwater mountain ranges. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Quarrenese, the native language to the Quarren species, is a unique collection of bellowed moans, reedy cries, and bubbly croaks capable of traveling great distances underwater. Without fluid to force through their mantles, Quarren find it difficult to speak Quarrenese in the open air. Because of this, most Quarren also speak Basic with a gravelly, sometimes gurgled, tone when communicating with others above water. Due to their frequent interaction with the Mon Calamari, Quarren also tend to speak Mon Calamarian.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Amphibious : Can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer movement penalties for traveling through water.</p><p>Ink Spray : Can spray ink.

They are known for their association with the Mandalorians, and the unique cultural divisions between their sexes. Both male and female Togorians are also noted for their strong sense of honor.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] As a species, they are large bipeds, with retractable claws on their hands and feet. Female Togorians are up to 2.2 meters tall, while adult males ranged up to 3.0 meters. They are covered in gray-white to black fur, often with more colorful spots or stripes. They have extremely dense bone tissue, allowing them to endure greater physical trauma than beings with similar physiques.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Togorians evolved as nomadic hunters of creatures like the bist and etelo. In turn, flying reptiles called liphons preyed upon the Togorians. Primitive Togorians noticed that slightly smaller flying reptiles, mosgoths, were also targeted by liphons who attacked their nests and stole their eggs. Togorians began camping near the mosgoths for mutual protection, eventually domesticating them as mounts. Soon, a rift in their society developed—while males wanted to continue their lifestyle as nomads, females wanted the comfort and safety of permanent camps. In other species, the conflict would have led to one lifestyle winning over the other, but both male and female Togorians are too stubborn.\n\n[P]Eventually, the males continued their nomadic ways, riding their mosgoths and hunting, and competing in contests of prowess. Meanwhile, the females stayed in villages with pre-pubescent children, with those communes eventually growing into cities. While the males continued to hunt in the wilderness, the females tended domesticated herds and developed technology. Males would visit their mates for about a month each year, but the sexes lived completely separate lives otherwise. Whether in spite of the separation of the sexes, or because of it, Togorians are monogamous, and devoted to their chosen mates.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Togoria is a planet in the Mid Rim and the homeworld of the Togorians.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Togorian is the native language of the Togorian species from Togoria. It is a harsh-sounding language.

{"name":"Umbaran","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/UMBARAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Umbaran[h4]\nThe Umbaran people have had a contentious history with the Galactic Republic. Members of the Republic since its founding, they have a long tradition of participating in galactic politics. Never afraid to break away from the majority, however, they have always prioritized Umbara over the Republic. Umbarans' political history has caused many other species to consider them mysterious, deceitful, conniving, and untrustworthy, and to call them “the Shadow People\" behind their back. Some believe Umbarans have powers to control others’ minds, and beings of most species admit to feeling unsettled in their presence.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Umbarans are near-humans with pale skin that has a faint tint of blue or purple to it. They naturally have pale hair, but Umbaran custom is to shave the head bald. Their eyes tend to have white or pale irises, again with a faint tint of color, usually gray or blue. Umbarans can see into the ultraviolet end of the spectrum and have adapted to low-light conditions, yet they are not greatly uncomfortable in bright artificial light. \n[P]Prolonged exposure to sunlight, however, causes Umbarans to suffer irritability and short-term memory loss, similar to sleep deprivation in humans. Several hours in complete darkness usually resets their physiology. Bioluminescent lights do not affect Umbarans this way, and sunlight screened through transparisteel doesn't affect them as harshly as raw sunlight.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Umbaran caste system is often believed to be rigid and complicated by outsiders, but their society actually allows a remarkable amount of social mobility. Still, Umbarans can fall more easily than they can rise. This system has more than a hundred tiers and titles, and families can shift their social status with enough popular support, political maneuvering, wealth, influence, or even through marriage. Of Course, more nefarious methods, such as blackmail, assassination, and bribery, have been known to occur. Some Umbaran sociologists and historians believe that this porousness in the social structure means that in a few hundred years, references to the caste system will disappear altogether. Although caste titles and names still appear in legal documents, no one truly follows or enforces them. However, an ambitious Umbaran might not be above using a caste title as an insult or in sycophantic praise. \n[P]This kind of culture might explain the Umbarans’ attitude toward galactic politics. A change in position isn't a betrayal, but merely a decision to better one's status. A fall in power isn't a disaster, but a setback to recover from. And a political victory isn't the time to celebrate, but rather serves as an incentive to keep pushing, for one never knows when one's fortunes are about to turn. \n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Umbara lies in the Ghost Nebula of the Expansion Region. Shrouded in clouds and perpetual night, the planet's surface receives no light from its sun, and the nebula’s gases and dust envelop the entire system. \n[P]Nevertheless, Umbara teems with countless types of flora and fauna—including plenty of the large and hostile variety. Quite a few of the world's plants and animals possess a form of chemical luminescence, a common evolutionary adaptation to either attract the attention of prey or scare off predators. For some species, this luminescence produces enough light for a creature to see its surroundings. \n[P][B]Language.[b] Umbaran, also called Umbarese, is the spoken and written language of the Umbarans. In the written language, each number and letter is inscribed within a closed circle, and punctuation within half-circles. Most Umbarans also learn Basic as a matter of course. \n[P]In a remnant of the baroque caste system, various social groups give certain common words slightly different pronunciations. Even the written language has minor variations that add serifs or tiny line strokes, or rotate letters a few degrees. Offworlders generally don't perceive these differences, but astute Umbarans and those obsessed with lineage can identify the speaker's or writer's caste relatively quickly. \n[P][B]Life under the Republic:[b] Umbara has been a staunchly loyalist world from the beginning of the Clone Wars. Senator Mee Deechi aggressively advocated for increased military spending in the face of the Separatist threat, and is harshly critical of Senators in the pacifist faction, who seek a peaceful resolution to the conflict. According to him, a stance that supports any form of acquiescence to the Separatists' demands is unpatriotic at best. \n[P]Umbara's commitment to the Republic may stem from the similarities between the Umbaran culture of political subterfuge and unchecked ambition and what many others consider to be the worst aspects of corruption in the Republic. Umbara's government has mastered the necessary bribery, blackmail, and other soft, negotiation tactics that have become increasingly common in galactic politics. Umbara's advanced technological base has given the world great influence in the Republic and fostered a strong economy. \n[P]Umbarans who have offworld face some discrimination. The Umbaran reputation for deceit predisposes many beings toward having a negative view of them. Many species find the appearance and mannerisms of Umbarans to be somewhat sinister, further strengthening such sentiments. By and large, however, most Umbarans who travel off world are more than savvy enough to overcome such preconceptions and succeed in matters both business and political—even if that does require some liberties with the truth.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Entrancing Gaze : Umbarans add [BO] to all Charm, Deception, and Negotiation checks.</p><p>Shadow Dweller : When making skill checks, Umbarans remove up to [SE][SE] due to darkness, and add [SE] to checks made in bright natural light.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 15 - Rise of the Separatists[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1,"exclude":false},"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1},"Negotiation":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"UMBARAN"}},"_id":"2C1cpJARYLVKKCj5"}

They are passionate scavengers, seeking out technology for sale or trade in the deep deserts in their huge sandcrawler transports. They have a reputation for swindling, as they have a penchant for selling old equipment such as outdated faulty droids to moisture farmers. However, they are extremely passive beings, and hardly put up any resistance to colonists of their planet unlike the other natives the Sand people, instead seeing foreigners as an excellent business opportunity.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Jawas are easily identifiable by their traditional brown hooded robes, though it is not unheard of for them to wear other colors. Other notable features include their glowing yellow eyes, small stature and high pitched, quickly spoken language called Jawaese.\n\n[P]Through the study of corpses and skeletal remains, Baobab xenobiologists discovered that Jawas appear to be gaunt, rodent-like creatures, with shrunken faces and yellow eyes. Conflicting research suggests that Jawas and Tusken Raiders, two native species of Tatooine, originally evolved from the same extinct species, the Kumumgah, as both have common genetic markers, while other research suggests Jawas originated from humans.\n\n[P]At all times, Jawa faces remain obscured by a shroud of cloth to retain moisture, hide their identity and dissipate their body heat. Polished orange gemstones are embedded within the fabric to protect the Jawas’ sensitive vision from the bright sunlight. The only physical parts that are exposed are their hands, which have tufts of fur on the palms. Jawas are renowned for their incredibly potent odor. Repulsive to most species, this odor contains incredible amounts of information such as other Jawas' identity, health, clan lineage, last meal, maturity, arousal and even their mood. Their odor is compounded by a mysterious solution Jawas dip their clothes in to retain moisture, and their view of bathing as being a waste of precious water, which attracts swarms of insects to gather in the recesses of their hoods. Jawas evolved several important survival traits, such as exceptional night vision and a strong immune system. A Jawa’s normal body temperature is 46°C (116 F) which results in a high metabolism and an efficient digestive system that draws all the needed nutrients from the Jawa staple diet of hubba gourd.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Jawas are a communal, compulsive scavenger species who spend most of their life devoted to scavenging the deserts of Tatooine in search of any scrap metal, droid or mechanical part left behind from millennia of star travel and technological advancement, where the dry climate of Tatooine preserves almost all debris. Most non-Jawas regard the Jawas as scavengers and thieves, a description that most Jawas actually find pleasing.\n\n[P]The Jawa’s unofficial motto is not to look for uses in a salvaged item, but rather to imagine someone else who might find a use for it. And this is evidenced in their endless search for wares with which to trade with almost any being Jawas encounter. They have a kind of instinctive feel for machinery and electronics, notorious for knowing how to get a piece of equipment functioning just well enough to sell.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Tatooine (pronounced /tætu'in/) is a desert world and the first planet in the binary Tatoo star system. It is part of the Arkanis sector in the Outer Rim Territories. It is inhabited by poor locals who mostly farm moisture for a living. Other activities include used equipment retailing and scrap dealing. The planet is on the 5709-DC Shipping Lane, a spur of the Triellus Trade Route, which itself connects to the Sisar Run. The planet is not far from the Corellian Run. It has its own navigation system. The planet acquired a bad reputation, often being viewed as the cesspool of the galaxy due to the large number of criminals who can be found there.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Jawaese is the native language of the Jawa species from Tatooine. It is mainly composed of meaningless syllables, supported by pheromone produced scents, which allow it to be understood. Jawa communication is based in these scents to such a high degree that the scent a Jawa gives out can tell others about that Jawa's mood.\n\n[P]Jawas cannot pronounce Basic language or many other extended languages due to several vocal limitations of the species. They can, however, learn to understand most existing languages.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Desert Dweller : Jawas may remove one [SETBACK] imposed due to arid or hot environmental conditions.</p><p>Reduced Silhouette : Jawas have a Silhouette of 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Mechanics":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"starwarsffg","systemVersion":"1.801","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1678299291659,"lastModifiedBy":"9txlheCZj1dqZrkb"}}
{"name":"Chevin","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/CHEVIN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Chevin[h4]\n\nThe Chevin are solidly built and hard to overlook, being taller than humans and nearly twice as wide. They have large, leathery faces and long, prominent snouts. Their impervious gray skin stretches over thick, muscular limbs, and their sense of smell is refined enough to identify a case of colored water in a shipment of booster blue. Once a species of hunters, Chevin are now renowned for hunting credits, a task for which they are uniquely skilled. \n\n[P]Trade is an important activity for Chevin, whether among themselves or on an interplanetary scale. They pride themselves on their business acumen, and consider wealth tantamount to prestige. Their main exports are slaves and slave-related technology, the only technology they have developed themselves. The Empire is the main customer for the latter. For this reason most Chevin consider the Empire good for business, and so accept and support Palpatine's New Order. \n\n[P]Chevin have developed a reputation for ruthlessness among other species. They drive a hard bargain, and their opportunist natures mean they capitalize on those in need. By Chevin standards, if a colony is willing to pay more than foodstuffs are worth to avoid starvation, the merchant should charge more. If the captain of a starship needs a spare part immediately or risks capture by Imperials, to ask a less than extortionate price makes no business sense. Chevin etiquette demands honesty, not mercy. \n\n[P]In a culture so obsessed by commerce, honesty plays a vital role. After all, honesty is an essential component of trust. Without trust, the trading and exchanging between Chevin villages would break down. As a result, the Chevin moral code requires them to be scrupulously honest, and so Chevin never fail to keep their side of a bargain. On the other hand, they expect the same values to be upheld by other species they deal with, and when double-crossed, they prove violent and unrelenting in seeking revenge. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Chevin are strong and tough, with thick hides that are both insulating and insensitive. They absorb damage, and it takes a lot to injure a Chevin or even cause him pain. Few humanoid species could successfully tackle a Chevin with anything less than a blaster. Fortunately, though they are by nature aggressive, given the choice Chevin are more likely to negotiate than fight. They earn more credits that way. \n\n[P]The double-lidded eyes of the Chevin allow them to see in sandstorms or blizzards. They once used their long snouts to track prey, and so their sense of smell is highly developed. Now they are more likely to use it to check the quality of goods than to follow a backshin's trail. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] On Vinsoth, the Chevin evolved alongside the Chevs, the other sentient species on the planet. The Chevin, being more aggressive and hardier fighters, long ago conquered and enslaved their near-human neighbors. Chevin were once hunter-gatherers, but as slavers they have come to rely on the Chevs. Their slaves manufacture and farm for them, while the Chevin have become expert traders and delegators who like to be in charge. Chevin demand respect and thrive in positions of dominance, making them well suited to leadership roles. They have a knack for sensing the potential in other individuals and putting it to good use. \n\n[P]A migratory species, the Chevin live in moving villages, using vehicles called \"lodges\" to transport their families and goods while their slaves walk alongside. Although Chevin dictators never leave the planet's capital cities, Chevin villages rarely stay in the same place for long. It is therefore is no surprise that Chevin are happy to leave their homeworld to trade, making their home wherever they happen to be. \n\n[P]It is telling of Chevin society that the more aggressive of them tend to rise higher and do better, becoming the leaders in politics and business. However, a Chevin would counter that this tends to be true wherever he finds himself. The galaxy is a dangerous and unforgiving place, and so the Chevin must be strong and ruthless to survive. This grim outlook is a typical Chevin trait, and means that the majority of their relationships with other species are business relationships. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Chevin homeworld of Vinsoth is in the Outer Rim. The terrain varies widely across the planet, from ice caps at the poles to deserts, mountains, and prairies. Though the Chevin can live almost anywhere thanks to their strong constitution, on Vinsoth they tend to roam on the vast grassy plains. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The official language of Vinsoth is Chevin. Most Chevin also learn to speak Basic for the benefit of trade and travel. They also ensure that their slaves speak both Chevin and Basic.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Advanced Olfaction : Chevin add [BOOST] to Perception checks involving the sense of smell.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Far Horizons[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Negotiation":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"CHEVIN"}},"_id":"3DVxlaz8XdqqAxcS"}

They are quite hardy, able to withstand long periods of discomfort, and live to around two hundred years of age.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Ugnaught are a race of small, pig like creatures known for their mechanical abilities. The Ugnaughts are native to the planet Gentes. There, they have grown to become strong, efficient creatures, able to withstand a great deal of discomfort. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Ugnaughts are ruled by elected terend councils, which are led by elected ufflor officers. They were also represented in the Cloud City's Parliament of Guilds. Ugnaughts live their lives in accordance to their \"blood profession\", with Ugnaught parents teaching their children their trade. Infant Ugnaughts are known as Ugletts. If the number of new Ugnaughts in a given profession exceeded the needed, a blood duel was called. When the Ugnaughts reached their twentieth year of age, these fights were held to the death, with the victor winning the right to inherit their blood profession. Despite this outdated and violent custom, the Ugnaughts are generally a peaceful people with a rich culture. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Gentes is known to most only as the home world to the Ugnaughts, industrious pig like creatures common on Bespin and other planets in the sector. Once a swampy paradise, sadly the planet has suffered from environmental damage from slave traders. In attempts to make the Ugnaught population more willing to be transported off their home planet, the slave traders poured toxins into the rivers and oceans, killing off many of the basic food species the Ugnaughts relied on, and though it is still a life supporting planet, the life it has is a shadow of the rich diversity that blossomed there before.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Ugnaught is the native language of the Ugnaught species from Gentes.

{"name":"Thisspiasian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/THISSPIASIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Thisspiasian[h4]\nThisspiasians are a people with great passions tempered by measured calm and discipline. They are attached to tradition but also quick to adopt the new, blending both together seamlessly. The Galactic Empire has failed to suppress their spirit. In fact, their defiance might spawn a new wave of Force-sensitive warriors.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Thisspiasians are two-meter tall serpentine creatures with four arms, distinct flowing beards, and long hair surrounding their heads and faces, The lower two sets of arms are somewhat vestigial in nature, and Thisspiasians usually keep them hidden beneath their clothes. Their reptilian nature encourages constant movement and activity to maintain blood flow. Though Thisspiasians sleep for a couple of hours a day, their main form of rest is a physiological condition similar to a trance that can last for minutes or hours. The trance provides the neurological repair necessary for good mental and physical health. Just like how other sentient beings who miss sleep can become emotional and irritable, so do Thisspiasians if they skip this trancelike state.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Outsiders consider Thisspiasians walking (slithering) contradictions. Their history values tradition, and their culture continues to practice several dozen small rituals and practices (such as eating their food live) taken from a myriad of historical Thisspiasian cultures and civilizations. This doesn't mean that Thisspiasians are rigid or dogmatic. They have been remarkably fluid in adapting to new technology and spacefaring cultural norms. Plenty of planet-born Thisspiasians have loathed giving up eating live thissp mice, but once offworld, they quickly adopt the practice of cooking their meals without complaint. (When returning to their homeworld, however, a common practice is to gorge on a live mouse banquet.)\n[P]Most outsiders know Thisspiasians only because of the fighters who volunteered to serve in the Galactic Republic's military during its initial founding. Tales depicted them as passionate and aggressive in one moment and calm and reasoned the next. This is no doubt due to the nature of their work; war and combat have a tendency to bring out extremes in any sentient being. Outsiders who first meet a Thisspiasian perceive then as tranquil and calm, but amongst friends, family, or on their homeworld, the individual in question might be loud and boisterous. Perhaps the initial impression was simply a self-imposed politeness in a sea of alien faces.\n[P]The confluence of reasons why the Thisspiasians joined the Republic requires an understanding of the Thisspiasian character. A constitutional monarchy ruled the homeworld at the time. The Blood Monarchy, a hereditary line that led back over twenty thousand years, technically provided cultural leadership, but a democratic parliament maintained practical, day-to-day governance. Even before the Galactic Republic, the monarchy was already a holdover from ancient times. The then-current Blood Monarch saw an opportunity to expand Thisspias' economy but to also secure her reign by joining the Republic. The decision was met with the usual acceptance of a society in flux: via loud, angry discussions and some mild violence.\n[P]At the same time, the planet saw a resurgence of ancient Thisspiasian martial disciplines. The Blood Monarch gave these warrior-monk societies, generally conservative and pro-independence, a purpose: join the Republic and fight for Thisspiasian glory. The gambit worked, and the planet's monarchy became a paradoxical symbol for galactic democracy.\n[P]Currently, an Imperial Governor controls the politics and governance of the planet, but the population seethes with anger, frustration, and rebellion. Originally, the Empire had occupied the planet to suppress Republic loyalists, but also to recruit Thisspiasians to the Empire in light of their \"bloodthirsty and barbaric\" warrior culture. Flooding the planet with anti-Republic propaganda, the Empire hammered on the decadence and distance of the Republic and offered the Thisspiasians a chance to fight for the Empire. The Thisspiasians answered with resistance. Orbital bombardments followed, and the Thisspiasians answered with more resistance. Finally, the Governor removed the Blood Monarch and demanded subservience. Instead. the empty monarchical seat serves as a potent symbol for insurrection.\n{P]On the other hand, many Thisspiasians still consider the hereditary line wasteful and archaic. This tension between royalists and monarchical abolitionists has been both dampened in some ways and intensified in others. The Imperial occupation forced these differing factions to work together and, on the surface, the groups hold no animosity toward each other. Thisspiasians can already see fractures, however, Royalists wear the quills of the giant ystervark both as a symbol of their loyalty and as a makeshift weapon. A few carry a small vial of blood, a statement of their genetic link to the Blood Monarch's line. Abolitionists, in turn, wear a small pin in the shape of a cygnat (a small native biting pest). This pin concerns even some moderate Thisspiasians, since nearly two hundred years ago the terrorists who assassinated the Blood Monarch wore a similar symbol.\n[P]If Thisspias survives the Galactic Civil War, historians wonder which symbol and resultant rituals will become the dominant part of their cultural lexicon: the ystervark quill, the cygnat pin, or the Imperial crest? Or perhaps Thisspiasians will buck tradition and choose a new symbol altogether?\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b]Thisspias is a rocky, temperate world in the Expansion Region. The homeworld joined the Galactic Republic enthusiastically despite its distance from Coruscant, sending warriors to bolster the fledgling Republic army. As a result, Thisspias has benefited from membership in the Senate while acting as a magnet for trouble in other moments in history.\n[P]For example, because of its close association with the Galactic Republic and physical location in the galaxy, Thisspias has been the site of many historical battles, such as the conflicts during the Great Manifest Period. These various battles have been immortalized with monuments or through the actual relics of war.\n[P]On the other hand, membership in the Galactic Senate allowed Thisspias to wield plenty of influence, especially to protect the homeworld. As pivot point between the Core and the Outer Rim, Thisspias benefited from a volume of trade and cultural exchange. Their people have plenty of reasons to remain loyal to the Galactic Republic.\n[P][B]Language:[b]Although planet-bound individuals are mostly literate in Thisspiasian, those who traveled offworld learned to read and write Basic quickly. The Empire has been trying to stamp out their language, but each attempt only emboldens them more. A few eschew learning Basic altogether in protest , but they are chided as foolish.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Some Thisspiasians practice meditation while in their trancelike rest, using guided focus and discipline to sort thoughts and feelings. A select few push further, opening their minds and spirits to touch upon the Force. Furthermore, Oppo Rancisis, the Blood Monarch heir who lived decades before the rise of the Empire, became a Jedi Master and refused to take the throne. This historical connection to the Jedi Order and the common practice of meditation give Thisspiasians a strong connection to the Mystic tradition and to the Force.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Rest and Meditation : Thisspiasians need very little sleep to function. They only need to sleep for two hours to heal all strain they are suffering from, instead of for a full night (they cannot sleep multiple times in a day, however!). In addition, once per session Thisspiasians may spend ten minutes meditating, if they do so, they heal strain equal to twice their ranks in Discipline.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 18 - Unlimited Power[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true},"Discipline":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"THISSPIASIAN"}},"_id":"3v5VwdDSJIoKxEPT"}
{"name":"Polis Massan","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/POLISMASSAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Polis Massan[h4]\nOriginally hailing from the Outer Rim world of Kal-lidah, the Kallidahin are more often referred to as Polis Massans. They are best known for their vast and intricate archaeological digs in the asteroid field that shares their adopted name. The Polis Massan people have searched for centuries, looking for a link between themselves and an enigmatic species—now extinct—called the Eellayin. Peaceful and isolationist, Polis Massans are experts in the fields of archaeology, medicine, and xenobiology.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Polis Massans are a small-bodied species standing an average of 1.4 meters tall. They are descended from a cetacean ancestor, as evidenced by smooth, gray skin covering a thin layer of insulating blubber. With the exception of a pair of expressionless black eyes, Polis Massans possess no facial features at all. Despite this, they are incredibly communicative in their use of gestures, signs, and body language. Though the majority of Polis Massans lack vocal chords, they are able to communicate with others using a simple form of telepathy.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Polis Massan society is based on community, the desire for fulfilling work, and a deep hunger for knowledge. Though they lack a shared consciousness, Polis Massans see their species as a collective in which everyone is supportive of one another and each\nmember serves an important role. As such, every Polis Massan views his fellows as siblings. Though there are invariably differences of opinion between individuals, they attempt to bridge these gaps by using their shared ancestry as common ground.\n[P]Polis Massans are kind and pacifistic to a fault. While fully capable of defending themselves, they seldom take up arms due to their belief that all life is sacred. Aggression is not in their nature, and anger and hatred are foreign concepts to them. This often leads to their being taken advantage of, since they rarely, if ever, put up any sort of struggle when their interests are threatened.\n[P]The overwhelming focus of the Polis Massan people is their attempt to find some link between themselves and the Eellayin. They view the Eellayin as kin, however distant, who were lost to some unknowable apocalypse. They seek to keep the memory and works of this mysterious species alive through their own research, even going so far as to attempt to clone them from Eellayin genetic material discovered in their explorations of the asteroids’ depths.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Polis Massans are originally from Kallidah, a moist and temperate world in the Subterrel sector. Soon after establishing a base on Polis Massa in an attempt to research the Eellayin people, the entire species relocated to the barren asteroid in order to support the excavations there. Though Kallidah is relatively close to Polis Massa, the Polis Massans have found no reason to return to their original homeworld.\n[P]Polis Massa is the largest asteroid in the Polis Massa Asteroid Field. The field is composed of countless fragments of the Eellayin homeworld, which was destroyed by some kind of cataclysm long ago. Though the asteroid is airless and incapable of supporting life, the Polis Massans have established a number of outposts where they can live and perform their research in peace.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The native language of the Polis Massan species is known as Massan. Because few Polis Massans possess vocal chords, the language is a combination of elaborate signs, body language, and telepathy. Though they are able to learn the languages of other species, the average Polis Massan lacks the organs required to actually speak them. A rare few Polis Massans do possess vocal chords, however, and many such individuals have proven to be skilled linguists.\n[P][B]Life in the Rebellion:[b] While Polis Massans have long supported the Rebel Alliance indirectly, it is a rare individual who actively seeks to fight against the Empire in a more direct capacity. When a Polis Massan does join the Rebellion, it is often in the role of a doctor, medic, or other healer. Polis Massan scholars have also been known to join the Alliance for a chance to see other parts of the galaxy for themselves and to meet members of other alien species first hand.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>No Vocal Chords : A vast majority of Polis Massans are born without vocal chords.</p><p>Telepathy : Polis Massans can communicate with other beings using a simple form of telepathy.  At short range, this is akin to a broadcast, and any being will \"hear\" what the Polis Massan says.

{"name":"Muun","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/MUUN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Muun[h4]\nDespite being an Outer Rim society, the Muun remain an important center in galactic politics; they started and maintain the InterGalactic Banking Clan (otherwise known as the Banking Clan or the IGBC) and stabilized the credit used from the deepest Core World all the way to the edge of the Outer Rim. While Muun culture as a whole is conservative and rigid, the personal beliefs of individual Muun vary wildly especially among those who travel the galaxy and mingle with other species. The Muun feel the same passions as any other species when facing moral and ethical decisions, fighting for survival or being influenced by the Force.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The humanoid Muun stand nearly two meters tall on average. Compared to humans, they have elongated heads and slim build, giving them a gaunt look. Their skin tone falls on the paler end of the spectrum, usually appearing white, pink, or gray. Their features—a small nose, mouth and ears—are subtle. Due to their three-heart circulatory system, the Muun have a robust constitution and can often live about a century.\n[P]Whether gained through natural ability or cultural influence, the Muun pride themselves on their advanced mathematical skills. Their children boast mathematical capabilities that rival those of university students on other worlds. Possessing a strong grounding in mathematics, logic, and science, the Muun have a reputation for intelligence and rationality. However, their history shows that they have some of their own harmful and dangerous biases, rooted in their pride and ego.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The traditionalist and conservative Muun believe their society a meritocracy in which the intelligent rise as through the ranks. Muun culture praises business and economics as the most intellectual and practical of pursuits. Those who don't join the IGBC, usually start their own corporation. Never the less, since the Banking Clan is such a massive and pervasive entity, it is difficult to know where it begins and where Muun society ends.\n[P]The InterGalactic Banking Clan, and thus the Muun people remained neutral in galactic politics throughout the Republic era to keep the economy stable. Muun internal politics tend to be similarly neutral and supportive of the status quo. This attitude has trickled down to individual Muun, who consider neutrality the highest form of political practice. In fact, most Muun believe they shouldn't concern themselves with the Galactic Civil War, an apathy that the Empire encourages. However, this conflict differs from others in that the Empire now controls the IGBC.\n[P]On the other hand, Imperial control over the Banking Clan and the soft occupation of Muun worlds have caused an increase in radicalized Muun, who reject the ideal of neutrality as a societal default. This new militancy is tempered by their conservative background. Rather than participate in outright violence or public protests, these budding activists engage in economic and corporate crimes, such as embezzlement and speculation, to siphon funds from Imperial accounts and disrupt Imperial businesses on Scipio. A few take these funds to fill Rebel treasuries, knowing that if the Rebellion succeeds, the Muun can become truly independent again. These brave few face myriad challenges; their peers' conservatism, their own doubts over their intuition and emotions about their homeworld, and the Empire's consistent message that a strong Muun is a compliant Muun.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Muun originated from the icy planet of Scipio in the Albarrio sector. Though it had powerful geothermal energy, the planet offered little in the way of natural resources. Another planet the Muun colonized, which they named Muunilist, was more temperate with rich mineral deposits. Drawing on Muunilist's abundant resources, the Muun were able to spread outwards into the galaxy. It wasn't new resources that rocketed them literally and figuratively into galactic politics, however. Instead, it was their establishment of the common credit—soon to become the standard currency for the galaxy—and the InterGalactic Banking Clan.\n[P]The rise of the IGBC on Scipio, and especially the laws the Muun put in place to keep its transactions as secretive as possible, have made that world a hotbed of power and intrigue. Hosts of outside agencies, power brokers, \"respectable\" representatives of crime cartels, and others reside here along with the native Muun, all endlessly plotting and dealing to better their economic interests. The Empire's powerful presence here watches over the flow of credits, working to ensure none are directed towards disloyal factions. All of this has transformed Scipio from a desolate ball of ice into a world filled with spectacular structures to house all of these players and their support personnel. Graceful arches and towering columns mix with stone cliffs and ice pillars to create wondrous vistas. The main vault of the IGBC itself is one of the most impressive architectural edifices in the region, but like everything else on Scipio, it is the credits within that make the greatest impression.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Muun rarely use their own language with outsiders, despite their insistence that the vocabulary and grammar possesses perfect mathematical clarity. One of the few intelligently constructed languages in the galaxy (as opposed to organically formed), Muun uses tones that make some species disparagingly call it an offshoot of Binary. The language's creators designed it to evolve by establishing new compound words instead of adopting loan words from other languages. This feature might be due to egocentric preference rather than any claim to logic as some newer words end up dozens of syllables long.\n[P]Muun traditional education teaches Basic less as a courtesy to other races and more as a practicality, since Muun deal with species from across the galaxy. Rather than learn additional languages, most Muun simply utilize protocol droids. Muun who travel widely may learn more due to circumstance, as a protocol droid might not always be nearby to hire or purchase.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Deep Pockets : Muun characters start the game with an additional 1,000 credits.

A highly aggressive and territorial species, Barabel who traveled off their homeworld find work as fringers or hired guns.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Barabel are a bipedal race of reptilians who are covered in very tough dark colored scales. Evolved from nocturnal lizards, the Barabel adapted a thick layer of fat which allowed them to remain active and not sluggish when temperatures dropped. A blaster set on stun would not damage them at all or slow them down, as it would merely bounce off their scales. Barabel are able to shed their tails if necessary, an ability that proved the undoing of many a startled foe. They also possess heavy retractable claws along with needle sharp teeth which could grow to be 5 centimeters in length. A carnivorous species, Barabel possess two stomachs in order to process the mass amount of food they required to survive.\n\n[P]For breeding, Barabel devised a system in which the nest eggs of two females were fertilized by two males. Subsequently, the four individuals protected the nest. As fathers would end up not knowing which of the offspring were their own, Barabel younglings took the surname of their mothers.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Living in low tech communities ranging from a few dozen individuals to no more than ten thousand, the Barabel community is built around a warren where from which the group thrives and hunts. The Barabel species is noted for its hunting and tracking prowess. This is because many of their actions are fueled by their hunting instincts, leading to the general feeling that Barabel are always angry, or in the very least ornery. They are well known for their aggression but are also extremely loyal to their mates and parents. They also have a great deal of respect for the Jedi, because of their first experiences with a Jedi master who settled a dangerous clan dispute. Apologies, whether for a misdeed or in sympathy, are an unknown concept to Barabel. It is considered mildly insulting to a Barabel to be apologized to and apologizing tended to actually make a situation worse. This sometimes is disconcerting for members of other species, especially Humans, who are more ruled by emotions such as guilt or sympathy.\n\n[P]Barabel are a communal race, with separate tribes on their homeworld numbering up to 10,000 individuals under the guidance of a pack leader. Unlike Humans, Barabel are much closer to the subconscious parts of their brains than other species. Lone Barabel tend to refer to themselves as \"this one\" instead of typical first person pronouns such as me or I. Some common Barabel names are Ragath, Vangar, Tesar, Saba, Zal and Zozoped.\n\n[P]The Barabel have a rich mythology which resolves around a historic landing of a group of Jedi Knights early in their history. Worshiping the Jedi as gods, the Barabel mythology revers these 'warriors from beyond the clouds.' Among Barabel beliefs are a group of demons called the Blight of Barabel. Their names are often used as curses.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] A murky world shrouded in darkness, Barab I's star is a dim red dwarf that made  the planet very dark. The planet orbits the star within less than 125 million kilometers, and the planet has a day period of sixty standard hours. During the day, the planet is irradiated with gamma, ultraviolet and infrared rays, forcing  all life on the planet to delve underground or cocoon itself else it be destroyed. Therefore, all species are nocturnal and adapted to hunt or forage in the evening without the risk of radiation poisoning. Because the world's oceans and standing water evaporated during the extremely hot day period, sudden torrential downpours  soak the planet at night, forcing the natives to hunt quickly or risk being washed away.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Barabel is the native tongue of the Barabel species, spoken on their native world Barab I. Barabel language includes mainly barks and hisses which are harsh-sounding. Barabels can speak Basic but they are not prone to learn it, unless they needed it.

The Elomin are tall and exclusively bipedal, with physical traits similar to those of\nother humanoid species in the galaxy. The Eloms are\nshorter, stockier, and covered in fur, and have a large\nhead with widespread eyes. The Elomin were known\nfirst to the rest of the galaxy, after Republic scouts first\nmade contact with the world. In fact, the surface dwelling Elomin were themselves ignorant of the Eloms'\nexistence until the former pursued extensive mining efforts and inadvertently crashed into the Eloms'\nunderground territories. The Elomin were not keen to\nshare their cold, dry world, but eventually yielded to\nRepublic pressure. The two species pursue a separate\nexistence from each other whenever possible.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Eloms evolved for life\nunderground. They are short and have a solid, stocky\nbuild, with large hands and feet that end in large\ncurved claws. They are adept at digging underground\nusing their clawed hands and prehensile clawed toes\nThey have wide heads with short, stubby eye stalks\non either side. Their dependence on centuries of\nphosphorescent light underground enables them to\nsee very well in dim light, but this makes them very\nsensitive to the bright light of the surface world. The\nEloms have a pair of closely set tusks low on their\nface, with nasal features set high between their eyes\nThe Eloms regulate their body temperature and moisture retention through a combination of rough, oily\nfur and layers of fat. They are herbivores and are\nparticularly adapted to eating the unusual plants and\nfungi that can be found or cultivated underground on\ntheir home planet, also named Elom.\n[P]Despite their laid-back manner, Eloms are intelligent and can be very ambitious. They are also highly isolated from other species, so Eloms unleashed on the wider galaxy tend to be a bit naive, at least initially. This makes them susceptible to suggestions, manipulation, and deception to convince them to do things against their own interests. Those Eloms who do travel the galaxy usually adapt gradually to a more cosmopolitan lifestyle.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Eloms reside almost exclusively\nunderground on their homeworld. Prior to discovery\nby the Elomin during the days of the form er Republic,\nthey were not technologically advanced. In fact, their\nmannerisms and unique societal structures prom pted\nthe Elomin to regard them initially as non-sentient,\nand so they once frequently enslaved Eloms in their\nmines. The Republic's representatives found otherwise and forced the Elomin to form ally recognize the\nEloms as a species with rights that they must respect.\n[P]The Eloms are largely pacifists and usually easy\nto get along with. Despite the difficulties during the\nmany years after the Elomin discovered them, the\nEloms were willing to put aside past Elomin behavior\nand move forward in peaceful coexistence. The Elomin were initially wary, and reluctant to accept responsibility for the oppression of the Eloms. However, after the\nRepublic's intervention, the Eloms never sought retribution against the Elomin, and eventually tensions\neased between the two societies, though they largely\nignored each other. Most Eloms preferred their underground society to what waited beyond the surface or\namong the stars. Years of Imperial rule have altered\nthat position, especially among the younger Eloms.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Elom is a frigidly cold desert world.\nElomin settlements and cities dot the surface. Their\ncities are as technologically advanced as those found\non most Imperial worlds. The planet is best known\nas a source of lommite, which is used in the manufacture of transparisteel windows for starships and\nother craft. Originally an industry contracted out to\noffworld mining operators, it is now controlled by the\nEmpire. Whereas the original agreements tried to\npreserve and respect the planet’s environment, the\nImperials place efficiency and production well above\nlocal concerns. The steady, continued destruction\nof vast areas of their world trouble and anger both\nthe Elomin and Eloms. Both have been powerless to\nslow it down, let alone bring it to a halt.\n[P]Elomin cities and towns are clustered in the more\nhospitable environments around the harsher deserts. Mining operations are farther afield, given that\nmines close to the oldest cities were depleted long\nago. Imperial interests and operations focus on the\nmines. Imperials in the cities have no qualms about\nforcing Elomin into service as miners. Banishment\nto the mines is a common and cruel form of punishment for anyone who opposes the Empire or offends\nthe wrong Imperial official. However, reasons for\nhauling someone away are just a formality, and the\nElomin understand that anyone could be next.\n[P]The Empire has largely ignored the Eloms’ deep\ncities, located far below the planet’s surface. The\ncities have varying levels of technology, depending\non the location and even the neighborhood within a\nsettlement. Most advanced technology is imported\nfrom the Elomin and sometimes beyond. Many cities, remote caverns, and dwellings are connected\nby natural and Elom-constructed tunnels. The tunnels range in size from those requiring single file passage, to more sophisticated varieties with paved floors and reinforced roofs. Some are large enough to allow for speeder traffic. Many of the cities and tunnels are so far underground that the Imperials have difficulty detecting them, let alone setting up surveillance. The cities are largely home to just the Eloms. However, some Elomin reused from Imperial mining efforts have been allowed to live among the Eloms indefinitely.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Eloms and Elomin have separate languages. The Eloms speak and read Elom,\nwhich non-Eloms can understand but typically have\ngreat difficulty speaking. Likewise, the Eloms can\nlearn to speak Basic, but it isn’t easy given their\nphysiology. It is rare to find much in the way of Basic\nspoken or displayed in the isolated Elom underground cities. Most Eloms who speak Basic live offworld, or have some connection to those who do.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Digging Claws : Elom may use a move maneuver to travel through loose soil or similar terrain.

{"name":"Dressellian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/DRESSELLIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Dressellian[h4]\n\nThe gruff, wrinkle-faced Dressellians are best known as gritty, tough outdoorsmen and master scouts. They are difficult to get along with, and distrust non-Dressellians, but once they strike up a friendship they are known to be fierce and uncompromising allies. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Dressellians are tall, thin mammalian humanoids with elongated skulls and wrinkled faces that mimic the shades and patterns of steepara tree bark. Some refer to them as \"prune faces,\" a derogatory term guaranteed to incense any Dressellian within earshot. Most Dressellian eyes can range from bright yellow to golden orange and provide slightly improved night vision. Dressellians are bright and agile, making them fierce warriors when cornered. Their blood is a bright teal, which is indicative of inefficient circulatory systems and a genetically recent marine heritage. As a result, Dressellians consume oxygen at almost double the rate of comparably sized humanoids. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Modern Dressellian society consists of a number of city-states run by direct representative democracies. While Dressellians from the same city-state share common views and work together, those from different city-states across the globe struggle to agree on anything. Not all Dressellians have embraced urbanization, and a large number of Dressellians still live in traditional nomadic groups. These tribes of hunter-gatherers wander the vast steepara forests that cover many of Dressel's islands and larger continents. \n\n[P]Traditional Dressellians depend on the near-kilometer-high trees to provide for numerous facets of their life. Giant steepara leaves have a unique texture that isn't quite like rubber or leather, which makes them ideal for use in both textiles and construction. Each tree is practically a habitat all its own, and provides for much of the Dressellian diet, which consists of steepara seed and syrup, cuirreal climber meat, and a variety of mushrooms. The steepara forests are not without their challenges, however; fierce predators, such as the wild, Wookiee-like erselu, the stalking panagra, and the swooping, large-eyed astrigia pose a constant threat to the natives. \n\n[P]Imperial occupation has banded the Dressellians together in a common cause unprecedented in Dressellian history. General Orrimaarko, the former governor of Sreeharlo, leads the resistance with the help of Generals Panno and Neeralli. Many Dressellians have reverted to traditional lifestyles to better evade Imperial reprisals, and do their part to support Orrimaarko's efforts. The Dressellians, with assistance from their longtime allies the Bothans, have become masters of guerrilla warfare, striking Imperial patrols and outposts from the backs of selldu during nighttime raids. Imperials on Dressel are almost exclusively human, and as such, the Dressellians have developed a negative view of most outsiders, especially humans.\n\n[P]While known best for their combat prowess during the Galactic Civil War, the DressellianS are also accomplished artists. Critics find Dressellian music, literature, and art deeply inspirational and filled with profound, universally accessible themes. The popularity of many Dressellian works has exploded recently among enemies of the Empire. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The moonless, temperate world of Dressel is in the Mid Rim's Noolian sector along the Askar Trace, a hyperspace route that once defined the coreward edge of Bothan Space. The planet has an oddly uniform distribution of large islands, and few true continents. The largest landmass is an equatorial island called Breehara, thought to be the birthplace of the Dressellians. Most land on Dressel is dominated by hilly grasslands and tall, ancient forests. \n\n[P]Bothan explorer Karka Vri'skar of clan Askar initially discovered the world two centuries before the Battle of Yavin, but, aside from the occasional trader or outlaw, the Bothans left the primitive Dressellians to their own devices while still maintaining regular diplomatic contact. Ten years before the Battle of Yavin, the Empire established a garrison and Imperialized Dressel's resources. The Dressellians engaged the Empire in guerrilla warfare, drawing on their skills as nomadic hunters and gatherers to evade the Empire. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Dressellians speak a native language of the same name. Scholars have described the language as flowing and organic, filled with soft sounds. However, over the past two centuries, the Dressellians have adopted a number of Bothan words, particularly to describe technology. Many art critics have blamed Bothan interference for tainting one of the great romantic languages, but it is widely agreed that the Dressellian adoption of the Bothan alphabet over their own primitive hieroglyphs was a positive influence.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Primitive : Dressellians must upgrade the difficulty of any checks involving non-Dressellian technology.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Survival":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"DRESSELLIAN"}},"_id":"81WxN2HOWHfXflK6"}

Renowned for their loyalty and devotion, Klatooinians have lived under contracted servitude to the Hutts for more than 25,000 years. First recruited to help defeat Xim the Despot, a galactic overlord vying for control with the Hutts, the Klatooinians signed a \"temporary\" pact of servitude that is still considered valid by both the Klatooinians and the Hutts today. \n\n[P]Understanding the Klatooinians' fixation with time is essential in order to understand the deeper underpinnings of their culture. Most of their mythology revolves around all-powerful patron-beings known as the Ancients. Tenacity and perseverance are among their most prized cultural traits, and they particularly revere elders of any race. When the Hutts first approached the Klatooinians with a request for assistance against Xim, many on the planet Klatooine came to believe that the Hutts were the Ancients, and that signing a pact of servitude to them was tantamount to agreeing to serve the gods.\n\n[P]The Hutts have dominated Klatooinian culture ever since, with the full blessings of most of the species. A Council of Elders determines Klatooinian affairs, but all offworld relations are in the hands of the Hutts. Klatooinian education is also completely under Hutt control. This has nearly eradicated all early Klatooinian culture and language. As civil war spreads through the Empire, however, some Klatooinians find the courage to break away from the Hutts and strike out on their own. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] With thick-set humanoid bodies and heavy, dog-like faces, the fierce appearance of the Klatooinians easily matches their ferocity in combat. The coloration of their flesh ranges from brown to a vaguely green tone, and males and females of the species display few outward differences. Klatooinians often reach nearly two meters in height. Their faces are dominated by heavy brows, blunt noses, and thick, prominent jowls. Klatooinians also possess strong, agile hands, giving them heightened manual dexterity. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Klatooinian society emphasizes loyalty and devotion over everything else while revolving around their near-worship of the concepts of time and age. The planet Klatooine is ruled by a Council of Elders. These members of the species are chosen for their age and experience, as well as how well they are able to articulate their understanding of Klatooinian mythology and culture in a series of ceremonial debates. The Council rules from a palace situated near the Fountain of the Ancients, located in the Derelkoos Desert. \n\n[P]Klatooinian education focuses on written and spoken Huttese, Klatooinian history, and legends that feature Klatooinian species-wide dedication to the Hutts. When a Klatooinian reaches adulthood it is delivered into slavery, at which point its future occupation is decided and more practical training begins. Before eventually being given a position or responsibility, the Klatooinian slave is usually granted more extensive training by his master for specific duties. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The planet Klatooine is an arid world composed primarily of deserts and vast, sweeping grasslands, located in the Si'klaata Cluster at the galactic northern extreme of Hutt Space. \n\n[P]The primary feature of the planet is the Fountain of the Ancients, considered a holy site by all Klatooinians and the seat of secular and religious power. The Fountain is a fissure in the planet's crust that releases liquid wintrium into the dry atmosphere. Wintrium solidifies upon contact with the air and appears like water frozen in mid-flow, continually hardening with age to the point of near indestructibility. After many thousands of years, the Fountain of the Ancients has grown to be a wondrous sight—sprays and waves of liquid frozen in midair.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Klatooinians exclusively speak Huttese on their homeworld, their own language having been purged from their formal education, even on Klatooine. Klatooinians encountered off-planet most likely speak and write Huttese and Basic. Klatooinian scholars or diplomats speak additional languages as needed.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Additional Non-Career Skill : Klatooninians start the game with one additional rank of one non career skill of his choice.</p><p>One Rank in Brawl : Klatooninians may begin the game with one rank in Brawl.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Dangerous Covenants[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"KLATOO"}},"_id":"87kV9ZNZNNeifQVq"}

For those with a price on their heads, a glimpse of a tapered green snout or an unmistakably putrid odor means a Rodian bounty hunter is on their tail. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Rodians evolved from climbing lizards and retain some of their ancestor's characteristics, particularly the large eyes and climbing suction cups on their fingers and toes. Nowadays, these physical features cannot hold an adult Rodian of 1.6 meters to a rock or tree for very long, but they have saved many Rodians from falls that would kill most other species. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The history of Rodia is a history of violence. Long ago, the tropical world teemed with vicious predators, necessitating that the Rodians' defenseless ancestors either adapt or die. Adapt they did, hiding in the boughs of trees or climbing high into mountain caves, where they fashioned tools and formulated plans to hunt down the predators. Their skills in the hunt grew quickly, and soon became the central focus of their society. \n\n[P]Rodians became so proficient at hunting that they gradually forced most of Rodia's other predators into extinction. With nothing much left to hunt, they turned on each other. Gladiatorial hunts between champions morphed into skirmishes and eventually tribal wars. \n\n[P]Rodia was almost blockaded when first discovered by Old Republic scouts due to the warlike Rodian culture. However, Rodian leadership was able to suppress their culture's violent tendencies long enough to make contact with the rest of the galaxy. Now, millennia later, Rodian culture has moved beyond the worst of its violent impulses; although, hunting is still a venerated tradition. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The world of Rodia in the Mid Rim is the Rodians' planet of origin. It merges urban and industrial development with tracts of untouched rainforest, providing brave Rodian youths with environments in which to test their hunting skills. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Because of the structure of their mouths, Rodians have a difficult time speaking Basic and some choose not to even try, relying exclusively on their native tongue, Rodese.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Survival":{"mod":"Survival","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"ROD"}},"_id":"9oSgQCcX71XinSKE"}

Renowned pilots and spacefarers, Corellians tend to have an independent, somewhat reckless streak coupled with an enterprising, can-do attitude that makes them ideal smugglers, free traders, and explorers. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Humans are the dominant species on Corellia. Though Corellians have a reputation for possessing quick wits and even quicker reflexes, there are no significant biological or physiological differences between the human natives of Corellia and humans elsewhere in the galaxy. They are genetically and anatomically as varied as most other human populations, though they tend to be slightly taller than average, and there are an unusually high number of Force sensitives among certain Corellian bloodlines. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Corellians have a reputation for being individualistic and pragmatic, with a recklessness that causes them to act impulsively. Often possessing a deep-seated rebellious streak, Corellians tend to view themselves as a breed apart from other humans in the galaxy, whom they generally consider somewhat staid and spiritless. This combination of enterprising individualism and confidence can easily be taken for arrogance (which in some cases it is) but Corellians generally prefer determined resolve and immediate action to any perceived indecision or vacillation. While thoughtful reflection and sagacity is considered a virtue among Corellians, it is not always a quality they possess. \n\n[P]One trait seemingly shared by nearly every Corellian is a particular fondness for piloting fast ships. This characteristic has translated to the Corellian philosophy of shipbuilding, namely that faster is better. Nearly all Corellians are capable pilots by maturity, and swoop and speeder racing are popular pastimes. It is generally accepted wisdom that Corellians have naturally good instincts and quick reflexes, explaining their ability to push vehicles and starships to their limits (and survive), though evidence for this is often more anecdotal than scientific. In addition to their piloting skills, Corellians are renowned explorers, traders, engineers, and tinkerers. Corellians pioneered many of the trade routes that crisscross the galaxy, and their ships are nearly ubiquitous. They also have a not-wholly-undeserved reputation as smugglers and pirates. \n\n[P]For a people often thought of as self-centered lone wolves, Corellians put a high premium on family bonds and filial loyalty. Honor and fidelity are universally valued among them, and a Corellian's word is his bond. Though it is said there is no honor among thieves, even the basest Corellian criminal possesses some sense of honor and a moral code that guides his actions.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] One of the founding planets of the Galactic Republic, Corellia is among the foremost worlds in the galaxy. The nearest planet to the star CoreII, Corellia is a temperate world of varied landscapes. Though much of the planet's surface remains pristine and rural, Corellia is dotted with sprawling cities—its capital, Coronet City, is one of the most lively, sophisticated metropolises in the galaxy. Massive shipyards and smelteries orbit the world, producing some of the fastest starships on the market.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Though a distinct Corellian language exists, Corellians most commonly speak Basic. Olys Corellisi or \"Old Corellian\" is rarely spoken and is virtually a dead language. Olys Corellisi is occasionally used by smugglers and other Corellians on the fringes of society as a simple code to keep their communications secret from prying ears.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Piloting - Planetary : May begin game with one rank in Piloting - Planetary.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Suns of Fortune[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"HUMANCOR"}},"_id":"9q4OlZUgw3ffn3JA"}

Their reputations for bad tempers and con jobs, as well as a history of being lackeys for the Hutts, makes for difficult going for many Toydarians, but their resistance to Force manipulation is seen by many others as highly valuable. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Toydarians have smallish, squat bodies that perpetually hover over the ground, thanks to a pair of wings on their back and an abundance of natural gasses absorbed into their frames. Stubby protruding snouts dominate their craggy faces, and their spindly arms and legs end with three fingers and three toes, respectively. One of their most interesting physical features has to do with their brains; they are completely immune to any manipulations via the Force. \n\n[P]Toydarians have extremely active metabolisms, and physical exertion of any kind burns up massive amounts of calories. As such, they are in constant need of food, eating large quantities throughout the day. Where available, Toydarians take advantage of highly concentrated processed foods that quickly fulfill their energy needs. In ancient times, Toydarian tribes fought most over food supplies. \n\n[P]Toydarians are well known for having a natural body odor similar to sweetspice, making them pleasant to be around for at least their effect on the local air.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Hutts subjugated the Toydarians long ago, yet it had little negative impact on their society's development. Effectively a grand business merger, the Toydarians enjoyed a rise in their standard of living in exchange for serving Hutt business interests. Toydarians have happily maintained a healthy distance from galactic affairs, more or less ignoring the rise of the Empire except as it impacts their mercantile interests. \n\n[P]Most Toydarians make their way within Hutt space, generally serving the interests of the powerful crime lords and helping manage the businesses and bureaucracies that make it all work.

They hail from a wealthy planet, and few\nnative Chagrians have wanted for life’s basic necessities—\nor even many of its luxuries. As such, Chagrians\nare rarely greedy or avaricious, and their desires are\nseldom motivated by such basic needs. Additionally,\nChagrians are sticklers for procedure and law,\nand they are unwilling to deviate from the legal and\nbureaucratic systems they are accustomed to. Such\npredilections ensure that Chagrians make excellent\nSoldiers, Commanders, and Diplomats.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Chagrians begin their lives in an immature\ntadpole form some thirty centimeters in length. Born in\nclutches of two or three siblings, they are cared for by\ntheir parents in sealed tubs kept within the home. As\nthey mature, Chagrian children develop arms, legs, and\nlungs that allow them to breathe air. Once their limbs\nare fully developed, young Chagrians leave the water,\nand the last vestiges of their intermediate physiology\nbegin to fade away. Adult Chagrians are humanoid and\nstand two meters tall on average. They possess powerful,\nmuscular bodies well suited to swimming and\nheavy labor. As a result of their homeworld’s exposure\nto an unstable sun during their species’ evolution, Chagrian\nskin runs the gamut from light blue to cerulean to\nindigo, and it provides them with an innate resistance\nto harmful radiation. Though their planet’s sun has\nbeen stable for millennia, this radiation resistance has\nbecome a dominant trait of their species.\n[P]Chagrians possess elegant horns growing down\nfrom the sides of their heads. Males possess a second\nset atop their skulls, called lethorns. Once used during\nmating rituals, the horns were also employed as\nweapons during formal duels. Though duels for mates\nhave since been outlawed, Chagrians, especially\nmales, consider their horns a sign of status. A large\nportion of Chagrian daily personal ritual consists of\ncaring for their horns, filing and decorating them in an\notherwise uncharacteristic display of vanity.\n[P]Despite having air-breathing lungs, Chagrians are as\ncomfortable below the waves of their planet as they\nare above them. They are excellent swimmers, and\ntheir eyes have developed to help them see in dim,\nsubaquatic light. Able to breathe underwater as well,\nChagrians can remain submerged for months or years\nat a time without suffering any ill effects. They adapt\neasily to the seas of other planets as long as the alien\nocean’s chemistry is similar to that of their own planet.\n[P]Because of their constant exposure to the salty\noceans of their planet, Chagrians can taste little else\nbut salt. As a result, their sense of taste is incredibly\nweak, and they obtain little pleasure from eating.\nRather than tasting food, Chagrian tongues act to\nenhance their sense of smell, much as those of some\nreptilian species. As such, they can often be seen\nbriefly flicking their tongues out when assessing the\nviability of unfamiliar food or drink.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Chagrian society is law abiding and peaceful.\nJustice, both legal and social, is valued above all other\nthings, and Chagrian courts are some of the most fair\nand balanced in the galaxy. Both criminal and civil\ninvestigations are meticulous and thorough, and even\nthe most innocuous forms of evidence are carefully\nstudied. Even those Chagrians put on trial are all too\nwilling to admit their guilt, and only the most craven\nChagrians deny the charges brought against them if\nthey are true. This ensures that most criminal trials\nare brief affairs with little, if any, fanfare.\n[P]Given their homeworld’s focus on tourism, Chagrians\nare accommodating and obedient—sometimes to\na fault. Despite this desire to please others, Chagrians\naren’t ignorant of cruelty or bias. In fact, their affluent\nculture allows them to take notice of social injustices\nmore quickly than other, less privileged species, who\nmight otherwise consider such inequity to be normal.\n[P]Because of the richness of their homeworld and\nthe amenities enjoyed by their people—such as\nexcellent medical care, higher education, and social\nequality—Chagrians rarely want for anything. As a\nresult, they are easily disturbed by concepts such\nas prejudice, homelessness, disease, and starvation,\nespecially when confronted with them on other\nworlds. Many Chagrians are so moved by such sights\nthat they seek to remedy them, whether through\ncharity, by taking direct action, or by using local law\nto initiate lasting change.\n[P]The majority of the Chagrian economy centers on tourism.\nChampala has always been a popular resort destination\nfor affluent travelers from the Core Worlds and\nbeyond.

{"name":"Vurk","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/VURK.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Vurk[h4]\nThis reptilian race has extended their nomadic tradition to the galaxy. Galactic society underestimates them due to their lack of interest in heavy industrialization and technology. They have, however, a complex system of personal governance and political involvement that baffles Core World politicians and philosophers.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Reptiles with dark, bulbous eyes and tall head crests, Vurks can breathe underwater as well as they can breathe open air. The warm waters and atmosphere of their homeworld provide much-needed external energy for their metabolism. Although they can function away from such optimal conditions, Vurks do find cooler climates (and most spaceships) a bit uncomfortable. Most Vurks journeying offworld utilize a wide variety of tricks to maintain their body temperature, from wearing heavy clothing, using careful meditation, imbibing hot beverages continually throughout the day, or retiring to a nice, hour-long warm bath.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Vurks are semi-nomadic, but in a different way than other species. It is not unusual for a Vurk community or a whole village to decide to move on, not only based on the changing of a season, but also for a philosophical need. Instead of the village relocating together, each Vurk (and perhaps close friends or acquaintances, but not necessarily family) may choose to travel together. For all intents and purposes, that village no longer exists. Vurks instead integrate with other communities or form new ones based on needs and desires. It is not unusual to find a mature Vurk who has already been in half a dozen successful communities.\n[P]The galaxy considers them a primitive people, but Vurks have a sophisticated community and social status system based on reputation. Vurks judge each other by their individual accomplishments, deeds, and actions, and readily discuss those perceptions with other Vurks. They don't consider this gossip or idle chatter, but part of the process of being in a community. Of course, two Vurks may perceive a third Vurk in two different ways, but none of them see this as a negative. After all, no individuals see things in the exact same way. Vurks don't expect outsiders to participate, but those traveling offworld naturally extend this practice to friends and loved ones.\n[P]This discussion of reputation and perception leads to continual interpersonal conflicts where two or more Vurks may disagree or social or economic matters. These conflicts then lead to compromises or experiments where Vurks try one solution before attempting another. In the end, these discussions lead to a set of casual rules governing behavior for each community, prompting even more discussion. Those who don't participate in the dialogue either choose to go with the majority or simply leave to found a new community While this social structure may seem anarchic, Vurks don't object to laws or social structures per se; they simply believe that these concepts are things to be discussed and negotiated on a case-by-case basis.\n[P]Each time a Vurk integrates or forms into a new community, a new discussion over mores and consent develops. Those who disagree, leave. Those who agree, stay. This social and cultural practice has developed and changed for as long as Vurks have had recorded history. To outsiders, this makes Vurks appear mercurial or constantly changing in ethics and morals. In reality, Vurks constantly question concepts of ethics and morals in order to understand where they stand.\n[P]There are outliers. of course. There are those who intentionally break these social or cultural mores, those who withhold information and lie in order to gain some form of advantage, and those who commit violence to resolve their issues. These individuals gain a reputation that gets passed on to each community they encounter. Eventually, these outliers get exiled, effectively turning them into a community of one.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Sembla (or Utavurk) is located in the Outer Rim. in the Mahrusha sector, at the far end of the Perlemian Trade Route. With four moons, tidal stresses keep the Vurk homeworld tectonically active, with shallow seas and volcanic islands.\n[P]Because Sembla doesn't sit near any major or minor trade routes, ships hardly travel there. The planet has been historically isolated from all of the Galactic Republic's wars. Some Imperial scientists, however, have established a research base to study Sembla as a source of geothermal energy and to experiment with the planet's unique magnetic magma. As a result, the Imperials have also undertaken strip-mining operations to build and power the base. pressing Vurks into a cheap source of labor and destroying nearby islands in the process.\n[P]The Empire doesn't respect the working conditions the Vurks must endure, and various pockets of resistance have appeared throughout the homeworld. Vurks on the other side of the planet don't see the results of Imperial power and have not decided yet to take up arms. In this case, the habit the Vurks have of discussing and witnessing firsthand an individual's bad actions may not be fast enough to unite the planet against the Empire.\n[P][B]Language:[b] On their homeworld, Vurks speak primarily Semblan. There are of course several hundred dialects and unrelated languages, but ages ago, through an intense period of planet-wide discussion, the majority of Vurks decided on Semblan as their language. (As a consequence, they also changed the name of their homeworld from Utavurk to Sembla to reflect this decision.) Plenty of Vurks disagreed and thus formed communities that speak other languages. Those who journey offworld, however, learn Basic.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Describing the Force as water or a river fits well with Vurks, who not only live on an aquatic world, but have wandered their planet much like the rain, rivers, and oceans. While Vurks don't have a specific connection to, or affinity for, the Force, certain concepts are easier for them to grasp due to their cultural background. Failure isn't a setback, but simply a new experience. Pick up and move on. This gives them an openness to try something different or try again in a new way, a perfect attitude for a Mystic.\n[P]Of the Vurks who initially tried to join the Jedi Order, most failed due to the rigid discipline. Instead of becoming bitter or discouraged, these petitioners merely saw this setback as part of their continual migration. Perhaps this was not the community they should be joining at this time. Oddly, a few of those who failed the initial tests later came back as better candidates.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Amphibious : Vurks can breathe underwater without penalty and never suffer movement penalties when traveling through water.</p><p>Cold Blooded : Vurks add [SE] to all checks they make while in cold environments (in addition to any other penalties).</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 22 - Unlimited Power[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Negotiation":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"VURK"}},"_id":"AyjIkCglQlqx3QRq"}

These people have five-fingered hands and eyes resembling the Human race after which their blood was mixed. They also have the pointed ears of the Sephi of Thustra, a species of humanoids with whom they also share genetic material.  \n\n[P]With stark white skin, the offshoots are easily distinguished from the pure-bloods and are often times shunned, even if covertly.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Arkanians themselves are not above genetic experimentation with this avenue of research leading to the creation of the Arkanian Offshoots that are engineered to perform specific tasks. Occasionally, a number of racist pure blood Arkanians were known to conduct purges of the Offshoot population. Reactions to the Offshoots varied as some Arkanians viewed them as little more than tools or even as slaves but many believed that they are an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Arkania is the adopted homeworld of the Arkanian species. It is covered with tundra and rich in diamonds and other precious minerals, which the Arkanians mine to further their offworld connections and master their technology.

They are slug-like, lacking legs and, as they gain their adult size, move only slowly. Although the most infamous Hutts in the galaxy tend to be gangsters and crime lords, Hutts can be found in nearly any profession. The following rules outline the creation of a character who is a young adult Hutt, only one or two centuries old. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] As they age, Hutts continue to grow larger and, if wealthy and powerful, more corpulent. Since Hutts can live for over one thousand years, the oldest and most powerful Hutts are very massive indeed. Even a comparatively young and vigorous Hutt has a flexible, muscular torso some two or three meters in length, topped by a broad head with two enormous eyes and a cavernous mouth. Compared to the rest of their bodies, Hutt arms seem stubby and short, although they are still powerful in their own right. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Hutt society revolves around clan politics, with Hutts of the same family expected to work to advance the status of the clan as a whole. Loyalty is important, as is taking vengeance for any slight. Due to their long lifespans, Hutts tend to be patient and are comfortable taking a long-game approach to most matters. Most Hutts do not particularly value the lives or freedom of non-Hutt life forms, and the Hutt species maintains several \"lesser' species in a state of near-universal bondage. Of course, some individual Hutts defy these stereotypes. \n\n[P]Most Hutt clans maintain family organizations called kajidics. To an outsider, there may seem to be no difference between a kajidic and a clan... and there may also seem to be no difference between a kajidic and a criminal empire. Indeed, many kajidics are heavily involved in the slave trade, spice trafficking, and other forms of interstellar crime; the Hutts' reputation as ruthless gangsters is mostly well deserved. A Hutt who does not join the family kajidic is an outcast. He has no proper place in Hutt society, and other Hutts have no idea how to relate to him. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Although originally from the world of Varl, the Hutts have long since claimed a new homeworld: Nal Hutta, whose name means \"Glorious Jewel\" in Huttese. Nal Hutta is mostly a polluted, swampy wasteland, of little interest to anyone but the Hutts. However, Nal Hutta's fifth moon, Nar Shaddaa, is a major spaceport and trade hub. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Hutt language, Huttese, is spoken by sentient beings throughout the galaxy. It is a major trade language whose universality rivals Galactic Basic, especially in the Outer Rim and Hutt Space. Hutts are perfectly capable of learning to speak Basic, or almost any other language, but some Hutts choose not to (or choose to pretend not to) as a means of establishing their dominance.

Adept at picking up on secrets or seeing things other species ignore, Bothans can be valuable assets in any endeavor&mdash;or untrustworthy partners. [P][B]Physiology:[b] Bothans have highly attuned senses which aid in gathering and relaying information. The noses at the end of their tapered snouts can distinguish many smells, and their eyes have an extended range of focus. They possess ears double the size of most species and can rotate and bend them to pick up directional sounds. Standing on average 1.6 meters, their small size allows Bothans to often go unnoticed and slip through cracks that would never fit a human. Their greatest asset is their fur. They can communicate with other Bothans by rippling their fur, demonstrating changes in mood and conveying more specific intimations in a code. [P][B]Society:[b] Every layer of Bothan society is based on the acquisition, manipulation, and utilization of knowledge. Sometimes likened to the Hutts and Twi'leks, Bothans take such comparisons as an insult. Prestige, not wealth, motivates them. A Bothan's reputation is, at the end of the day, all he has. The Bothan Council governs the Bothan worlds. The major clans all have one representative in the Council, which then elects the Council Chief. Bothans shun outright confrontation. Information is their weapon, and Bothans play secrets like a Corellian plays sabacc: the truth is the ace up their sleeve. [P]The Bothans operate the most elaborate and extensive intelligence network across the galaxy. This \"spynet\" works through moles, provocateurs, sleepers, and drop-offs which transfer information down a clandestine web to the Bothan spymasters. Though the spynet hubs on Bothawui are Bothan-run, the majority of its \"placed\" agents are foreign species. [P][B]Homeworld:[b] Bothans hail from Bothawui, a temperate world in the Mid Rim. They have also established major colonies on Kothlis and Torolis. [P][B]Language:[b] Bothese is the native tongue of the Bothans and Botha is its written form. Almost all Bothans are fully fluent in Basic. Wrendui, which in Bothese means the nonverbal cues and emotions a Bothan can communicate through his fur, has many coded forms that a spectator can translate into explicit information if the cipher is known.

Considered to be as faceless, identical, ones emotionless as the members of droid army they fight, clones know of their origins and purpose. Rather than struggle against their destiny, most Republic clones fully accept their engineered life, celebrating their bonds of purpose and background. \n[P]From a certain point of view, the clones of the Grand Army of the Republic have the strongest ethical fabric in the galaxy. They fight for a greater good: the safety and protection of the Galactic Republic. They willingly sacrifice themselves for - their brothers-in-arms. The majority would never even consider betraying those ideals. What other sentient can say that?\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Physically identical, and based on the genetic template of bounty hunter Jango Fett, clones can be considered standard humans-though they age at a vastly accelerated rate as a necessity for the creation and sustainment of the fighting force. When decanted, almost all clones share Jango Fett’s black hair, dark-brown eye color, and olive skin tone, Some genetic variants exist, although most are confined to Kamino as case studies-or embarrassments.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Genetically tailored to obedience and trained for loyalty, clones develop a sense of family with their peers and many of their commanders, who are like their brothers and wise elders. Even though Jedi Knights and Jedi Masters serve as general and high-ranked commanders, shaping and deeply affecting the clones' lives, clones don’t consider them family. for example, even though it could be argued that Jedi Master Sifo-Dyas was responsible for the clones' existence, the clones instead consider the near-mythologized Jango Fett to be their father figure. \n[P]Despite the common public perception, clones of the Grand Army do have individual traits and personalities. Most have individual nicknames, and even clone commanders identify each of their soldiers with particular skills and talents. After all, if one clone soldier has shown competence in an ability, such as demolitions, his commander has to be able to identify and order him to perform that task. As sentient beings, the clones recognize not only their similarities to but also their differences from each other; despite their rigorous military training, they experience unintentional social pressures from their peers both to conform and to stand out. A clone soldier who takes on a reckless—but successful—action gets called \"reckless\" by his peers. This gives him a reputation for recklessness, which, strangely enough, might compel the clone to undertake further brash actions. The intensity of war exacerbates this tendency, so the older and more seasoned a clone gets, the more personality quirks he develops. \n[P]Of course, the rare clones who escape the military program accrue a haphazard education, usually focused on survival Nevertheless, they retain many of their military habits. Despite their personality quirks and personal beliefs, these runaway clones still refer to their peers as \"brothers.\"\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] All clones come from Kamino, and official Republic documents likewise record it as the homeworld of each clone. Like any natural species, drones feel a great regard for their homeworld and are fiercely protective of it. \n[P]As an engineered people in service to the Republic, clones of the Grand Army tend to see their fellow soldiers as family, dead comrades as ancestors, new recruits as descendants, and their ships or barracks as their places of work. Clones generally have little reason to return to Kamino, yet the word “home” conjures thoughts of the planet, especially after the Separatists' attempted invasion.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Clones speak Basic. the language of the Galactic Republic. While they have the capability to learn new languages, military life restricts them for the most part to practical military knowledge. Continued exposure to other cultures may give them time to learn, but not enough to be fluent. Time in the field tends to pepper a clone's language with military jargon and slang, such as “clankers” or \"rollers\" (for droids), “poppers” (grenades), and “shinies” (rookies), and acronyms such as BLOB, which means “big lump on board\"—or useless civilian— and FIDO, which means “forget it, drive on.”\n[P][B]Life under the Republic:[b] Most Republic clones don't interact often with the citizens they have sworn to protect. They may speak with Jedi or with Republic government officials, but mostly in the context of receiving orders or mission briefings. Clone troopers live a regimented life in military barracks at sector headquarters The Republic military even governs their recreation. scheduling games and competitions, both physical and intellectual. Study and additional learning focuses on combat tactics, strategy, military history, and leadership.

Depression and other psychological maladies are common among those who have endured stretches of time without company. \n\n[P]On Chad, the Chadra-Fan live in small cyperill tree-top dwellings connected by a series of makeshift bridges and platforms. Over the past few centuries, the planet has suffered several ocean floor groundquakes that created powerful tsunamis, including a gargantuan disaster a decade ago that wiped out most life on the planet. These giant waves have destroyed most Chadra-Fan attempts at urbanization, limiting them to the flexible cyperill trees. The tsunamis have also created an unnatural fear of drowning and water in general across the species. \n\n[P]The storms are so central to Chadra-Fan life that many still follow a religion organized around a deity thought to live at the bottom of the ocean. This deity controls the entire ocean, and when the Chadra-Fan upset Him, He fans His tail violently and creates a tsunami. The religion is ancient, and though only a small percentage are devote, most every Chadra-Fan is aware of it. \n\n[P]Due to these frequent disasters, the Chadra-Fan often find themselves picking up and rebuilding elsewhere. Asa result, the concepts of personal space and private property are foreign to them, and Chadra-Fan infamously tinker with strangers' technological items without asking permission. This irresistible compulsion often gets them into trouble. \n\n[P]Demand for Chadra-Fan scratch-built technology is growing, thanks to a recent movement that treats the gadgets like masterful sculptures. These gizmos are cobbled together from spare parts and common items and components adapted for unexpected uses, with a Chadra-Fan kit-basher's design aesthetic. Custom-built devices often go for top credit in silent auctions, thanks to a number of major corporate representatives with an eye for patent chasing added to the bidding wars. Chadra-Fan are popular in engineering think-tanks because of their unorthodox approach to cannibalizing existing technology and re-purposing it as something unexpected. \n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Also known as Chad Ill and Chadra, Chad is a sparsely populated water world located just off the Perlemian Trade Route in the Outer Rim's Jospro sector. Chad has an eccentric orbit that makes it alternately the third or fourth planet in the Chad system. Chad has nine moons, which contribute to a complex tide system that can create massive tsunamis with only the slightest influence from semi-regular groundquakes. The Chadra-Fan live in treetop cities among the cyperill bayous, while human colonists live onboard massive rancher-arks. \n\n[P]Chad is an agriworld, and one of the largest exporters of milk in the galaxy. The lactil is a docile, hoofed herd beast that generates a large quantity of milk despite the scarcity of grazing land. Chad is well-regarded throughout the galaxy for their cheese and gourmet caf creamer. Despite the popularity of their dairy products, the bulk of Chad's agricultural exports are water-based.\n\n[P]Chadra-Fan farm wander-kelp and slugs in paddies, most of which are exported as feed for herd animals, though the wander-kelp also has medicinal properties with applications across the galaxy. The bravest Chadra-Fan and human colonists live in large ocean platforms or mobile arks, where they live as ranchers, raising the massive, corvette-sized bildogs and docile sea cows. Most of these ranches have a remote-controlled buoy system that emits a shock if a branded creature swims too close. Ranchers often tend their herd from the back of a cy'een, tsaelke, or methnap, three very similar, long-necked amphibians known for their grace in the water and melodic calls. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Chadra-Fan have a native language of high-pitched chitters and squeaks that reach into the ultra-sonic range. Due to the limits of most humanoid hearing and vocal chords, Chadra-Fan not fluent in Basic often need an interpreter or protocol droid. However, most Chadra-Fan speak Basic, thanks to dozens of human colony arks floating on Chad's oceans. The Chadra-Fan language does not use a pause or silence to separate words or thoughts, and as a result, they tend to speak Basic very quickly, endlessly stringing words and sentences together without pause. Their Basic comes out high-pitched and squeaky, and can quickly grate on those with a preference for peace and quiet.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Acute Senses : Chandra-Fan remove up to [REMSETBACK][REMSETBACK] from Perception checks due to superior senses.</p><p>Reduced Silhouette : Chadra-Fan have a Silhouette of 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Mechanics":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":2}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"CHADRA"}},"_id":"D7tCVtSJWhN4duZ8"}

The only obvious feature of their furry faces is their four black eyes, but it also holds a proboscis through which they speak their buzzing native language and feed. [P]They are gently, kind-hearted beings who are slow to anger. The four eyes of the Talz are perhaps his or her most remarkable feature. One pair is adapted to see clearly in light so blinding that it might burn the corneas of most other beings, while the other pair can see in near total darkness. The end result is that Talz can see in virtually any lighting conditions and are not blinded by bright flashes.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Most Talz are unaware that a vast galactic civilization exists beyond their world. Imperial scouts discovered them as the New Order was putting a final end to the Republic. The Empire recognized that they had discovered a ready-made slave labor force to extract the mineral wealth of Alzoc III. But all the Talz know is that one day, rocks fell from the sky, and out of these rocks stepped strange beings who forced them to give up their normal routines to make caves. The Talz live in the hope that the strange beings will leave someday so that life can return to normal.\n\n[P]Due to the timing of the world's discovery, the New Order did not log the existence of the Talz, not wanting to be burdened by the Senate regulations relating to the treatment and handling of primitive sentients. Even after the Empire was firmly entrenched, they kept the mines on Alzoc III and the enslaved Talz a secret. As such, the Talz are very rarely encountered anywhere but Alzoc III, and those who do show up elsewhere tend to be in the service of Imperial officials. A few Talz have fled their homeworld and escaped Imperial custody through a variety of means, but those who stray too far from loosely controlled systems on the far fringes of the Outer Rim tend to be captured and sent back to their homeworld.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Alzoc III is the only truly habitable world in the Alzoc system, and yet thanks to its axial inclination of 23 degrees, it is largely covered with frozen plains, broken up only by the occasional volcanoes and icy seas. Alzoc III’s sidereal orbital period is over five hundred and twenty two days long, with a day last nearly seventy three hours. The temperate rarely rises above five degrees Celsius, though at the equator it can sometimes rise as high as twenty Celsius, though the weather is surprisingly calm for a world of its type. The atmosphere is comprised of fairly typical gases, most notably nitrogen and oxygen, though there has been a gradual build up of carbon dioxide due to the industrial pollution created by the Empire’s unrestricted mining enterprises on the planet.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Talz or Talzzi is the native language of the Talz species from Alzoc III. It is mainly formed by buzzes and chirps, with variable pitch being an essential feature.\n\n[P]The Talz throat and proboscis structure make them unable to speak most languages of the galaxy except for their own. Most Talz are not fluent in Basic and have no understanding of it. As Talz language is not very well-known outside Alzoc III, protocol droids are usually not fluent in that language, although they could easily be programmed to translate it.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Insulated fur : When making skill checks, Talz remove [SETBACK] imposed due to arctic or cold environmental conditions.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"TALZ"}},"_id":"D8Macjel7gYrNCrO"}
{"_id":"DbMiIdGbpBCBETK2","name":"Aqualish","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/AQUA.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Aqualish[h4]\n\nThe Aqualish are a triad of semi-aquatic sub-species evolved from aquatic mammals on the planet Ando. Considered one of the most aggressive and contentious species in the galaxy, the Aqualish have found themselves at the center of galactic division and discord since their first contact with other species. \n\n[P]The three sub-species diverged in their evolution thousands of years ago, resulting in three related races sharing the single water planet. All three sub-species appear similar, featuring two enormous downward-thrusting tusks, a skin color ranging from green to blue, and fringes of wiry hair along their jawlines and the backs of their heads. However, there are also considerable differences that figure prominently in how each sub-species is perceived offworld. \n\n[P]The Aquala, or \"finned Aqualish,\" form the majority on their homeworld and are the least adapted to life outside of their home oceans. They still possess fins rather than hands with prehensile fingers. The Ualaq have evolved five-fingered hands, but are the only sub-species that retained a second set of eyes, the better to see within the darkness of deep caves and dark forests, their chosen habitats. The Quara are the most humanoid in appearance, having five-fingered hands and only two eyes. \n\n[P]All three varieties of Aqualish are violent and warlike, quick to take offense and slow to forgive the slightest insult. The history of the Aqualish is rife with wars and conflicts, from early struggles amongst themselves to their legendary first contact with an alien species. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Each of the three sub-species of the Aqualish stands roughly a meter and a half tall. All three possess bulky bodies, with the Aquala's being further distended with a healthy layer of insulating fat. However, most Aquala spend their entire lives on Ando, seldom if ever leaving their homeworld. \n\n[P]Both the Ualaq and the Quara are far more likely to be seen off-world, since their hands are better suited to using the technology of other species. The Quara have a reputation for being thugs and criminals, while most of the Ualaq have moved offworld to avoid persecution by the Aquala. \n\n[P]The facial features of all three Aqualish sub-species combine elements of arachnid and aquatic mammal evolution. The placement of their tusks is often reminiscent to most sentients of the mandibles of a giant spider, aggravated by the thick fringe of wiry brown or black hair and their black, pupil-less eyes. The skin's rubbery consistency and rough texture, meanwhile, recall the hides of a variety of aquatic mammals. Because of the close placement of their two sets of eyes, the Ualaq are the most arachnid in appearance. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The three sub-species of the Aqualish have a long history of antagonism towards each other. Once they secured hyperdrive technology, combat amongst them nearly ceased as they extended their violent tendencies to their galactic neighbors. \n\n[P]The Aquala are by far the most numerous of the sub-species on Ando. The Quara are the least numerous and most aggressive. In fact, more Quara live elsewhere in the galaxy than on their homeworld. The Aquala blame the Quara for the Aqualish's galactic reputation as thugs and persecute them mercilessly, contributing to the cycle of Quara emigration. \n\n[P]All Aqualish culture is centered on belligerence and strength, and violent physical confrontations are common in almost all forms of interaction. Because of this focus on brutality and conflict, the subtlety and restraint required in negotiation are not among their most common attributes, making it hard for any outsider to interact with them diplomatically. \n\n[P]The Aqualish are not adept at designing and developing technology and instead tend to slap together bits and pieces of other species' equipment in a less-than-efficient manner. Because of this, the Aqualish are often seen as scavengers, adding to their unsavory reputation throughout the galaxy. \n\n[P]Due to their innate aggression, most individuals from all three Aqualish sub-species are natural bullies, tending to challenge any new acquaintance with confrontational behavior meant to test their strength and resolve. Any perceived weakness is met with continued persecution. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Aqualish sub-species hail from the aquatic world Ando, located in the Lambda sector in the galactic south-east along the Corellian Run. The planet is almost entirely covered in oceans, with what little dry land there is given over to swamps, rain forests, and rocky projections featuring deep, wet caves. These small land masses are generally shrouded in steam and fog all year long. \n[P]Ando's capital city, Quantill City, mirrors the division of the planet and indeed the species as a whole. The city is divided into Aquala and Quara districts, while the Ualaq are nearly unrepresented. Quantill City is home to the planet's primary spaceport as well as the Imperial legation. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] All three Aqualish sub-species speak similar dialects of the language that scholars know simply as Aqualish. However, it is nearly impossible for other sentients to speak this language due to the Aqua lish's massive tusks, and thus most off-world Aqualish are fluent in Galactic Basic as well. \n\n[P]Due to the construction of Aqualish vocal cords and the limitations imposed by their over-hanging tusks. it is impossible for Aqualish to speak in Basic without it sounding abrasive and harsh. This only serves to further the perception of the Aqualish as brutish louts.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Underwater Breathing : All Aqualish are capable of breathing underwater.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Dangerous Covenants[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true},"Brawl":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"attr1668996641421":{"modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"mod":"Resilience"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"AQUA","loaded":false}}}

They are known for their loyalty, passion, and temper. Quick and powerful, they are considered great warriors and dedicated, efficient predators. Cathar have high moral values, learned from both family and society. Their females are prized as slaves, whereas the males are generally regarded as too uncontrollable for slavery.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b]The baseline Cathar has fur-covered bodies with thick manes. They have prominent, retractable claws that can deliver powerful killing attacks on foes and prey. Their bodies also possess rapid healing abilities. On average, Cathar are 1.5 to 1.9 meters tall. These traits make them the perfect hand-to-hand specialists.\n\n[P]The Cathar species also had two additional subspecies, known as the Juhani and the Myr Rho. Both of these are notably less catlike than mainline Cathar. Cathar are born into a litter.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] On their homeworld, Cathar live in cities built into giant trees, and are organized into clans governed by \"Elders.\" Stories of their great heroes are often carved into the trunks of these tree-homes for following generations to see. The Cathar mate for life, to the extent that when one mate dies, the survivor never has a relationship with another. Cathar clan society includes great pageants and celebrations, especially for their heroes. Their religion includes a ritual known as the \"Blood Hunt,\" in which Cathar warriors individually engage in combat against entire nests of Kiltik in order to gain honor and purge themselves of inner darkness.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Cathar is the homeworld of the Cathar species, filled with many ecological niches and huge insect predators.

As trackers, they are matched only by the Gand. As hunters, they are the equal of the Trandoshans and Defel. As killers, they are virtually unparalleled. Fortunately for the rest of the galaxy, Sakiyans tend to have very little interest in anything beyond their own star system and rarely venture far from their homeworld. \n\n[P]Although the Sakiyans' hunting prowess would seem to make them better suited for ground-level living, an entire segment of Sakiyan society has moved above their traditional forest encampments to grand and lofty repulsorlift cities. There, the Sakiyans' best and brightest minds have continued to develop and perfect their repulsorlift technology, which they export across the galaxy. It is this expertise that has allowed them to resist multiple attempted conquests over the years. \n\n[P]Sakiyans are renowned as bounty hunters and assassins; those who leave their homeworld, Saki, find their skills in high demand among the Hutt kajidics. Yet, there is no love lost between the proud Sakiyans and the Hutts, who would dominate them and their homeworld given half the chance. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Though superficially similar to humans, Sakiyans are a distinct species, having evolved along convergent lines but possessing various notable features. Most visibly, Sakiyans have enlarged, bifurcated craniums, lack any hair, and have pointed ears. Their skin is highly reflective, like burnished metal, and varies in color from jet black and dark grey to varying shades of red, blue, and purple. Pale-skinned and albino Sakiyans exist as well. Nearly twice the size of the average human brain, the highly evolved brains of the Sakiyans are able to process impressive amounts of sensory information. As such, Sakiyans have extraordinary senses: they are able to see into the infrared spectrum and possess truly exceptional hearing and smell. Some Sakiyan hunters are said to track their prey by smell alone. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Sakiyan society is organized around complex family and clan relationships. Known as prides, Sakiyan clans form the basis of their communities. Protecting and defending their families and prides are the overriding concerns of members of the species. As such, Sakiyans tend to be territorial and suspicious of strangers and outsiders, especially non-Sakiyans. The prides are largely homogeneous, relatively insulated groups, and pride leaders exercise familial and political authority over their clans and communities. Sakiyan skin tones are one means by which prides identify themselves, though there is little overt prejudice based on skin color between most groups. The notable exception to this is the bigotry directed against light-skinned Sakiyans, who are generally viewed as aberrations by the rest of Sakiyan society, even their own kin. Because of this, pale-skinned and albino Sakiyans are more likely than others to leave Saki and forge their own paths in the galaxy. \n\n[P]Predators at their core. Sakiyans take great pleasure in the hunt and regard hunting as the truest test of a being's worth. They tend to view themselves as the ultimate hunters—with some justification—and regard most other species as little more than cud-chewing prey, barely worthy of the most minimal respect. Sakiyans are also noted for their distinct lack of humor as well as their intellectual and problem-solving abilities; they rarely take kindly to being proven wrong. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Situated on the edge of the Bootana Hutta, deep within Hutt Space, Saki is a tropical world of broad oceans and lush rain forests, which have been preserved by the Sakiyans' remarkable repulsorlift technology. Rather than clear away their hunting territory, they have instead expanded skyward with massive floating cities and fortresses.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Despite being under the economic dominion of the Hutts, the Sakiyans have maintained their own cultural identity, which includes their native language.

They are renowned for both their inherent confidence and their martial prowess. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Zabrak physiology is similar to human, with several notable differences, including the presence of a second heart and a heightened resistance to physical pain. Zabrak vestigial horns emerge at puberty; they are a sign that an individual is reaching maturation and nearing the age of the traditional rite of passage. Zabrak skin colors range from near-ivory through browns to near-black, in a broad range of tones. Some have hair, but many are completely bald. Eye colors include the common human range, but can also include yellow, red, and orange. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Upon completing the rite of passage, Zabrak adopt a pattern of facial tattoos. These are generally made up of a pattern of thin lines and elegant designs. They are often based on family tradition, but can also incorporate personal designs or representations associated with significant events. \n\n[P]Zabrak are renowned for their self-assurance and independent natures. The harsh conditions of their homeworld, Iridonia, led to a particularly competitive and warlike nature in Its inhabitants. Thus, study in martial arts is common throughout Zabrak cultures. The bladed quarterstaff—known as a zhaboka—is a culturally significant weapon to Zabrak; historically, Zabrak would wield zhabokas while riding reeks, their war mounts. The combination of determination and military prowess has made Zabrak culture extremely resistant to Imperial domination. \n\n[P]In concert with their militaristic tendencies, Zabrak have established a reputation as exceptional weaponsmiths. They craft both traditional melee weapons and reliable blasters. While none of these armaments are mass-produced, they can still be found throughout the galaxy (sometimes when Zabrak surreptitious-ly arm other oppressed species). \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Zabrak are native to Iridonia, a world located in the Mid Rim. Because its environment is so hostile to life—conditions include brutal weather. acidic seas, and a host of predatory wildlife—many Zabrak were quick to embrace spacefaring and migrate to other worlds. Consequently, many Zabrak identify themselves with their colony world rather than the homeworld of their species. Zabrak colonies can now be found spread across the galaxy. from established colonies on major metropolitan worlds to enclaves in entirely unexpected locations, such as the mountain colonies found on Dathomir.

Only Togrutas who are independent-minded—a relatively rare trait for them—travel off-world. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Togrutas are a near-hairless, mammalian, humanoid species that average 1.7 meters in height. Their skin tones tend towards bold colors like orange or red, and most individuals have contrasting white pigmentation patterns scattered across their bodies. They have three—or rarely. four—head-tails. Two are normally draped across the front of the body, while the other falls to the back. Above these, they have two hollow montrals, which are used for a simple form of echolocation that enhances their keen senses.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Togrutas evolved from pack hunters, and their society continues to demonstrate this heritage. While urban life has begun to emerge, the majority of Togrutas still live in dense communal villages within Shili's forested canopies and hidden valleys. In these places, they live in harmony with nature. Every member of a community is expected to learn to work in concert with other members of the pack, contributing to everyone's overall success. \n\n[P]Togrutas have little sympathy for those who can't contribute to society. However, most Togrutas quickly point out that contributions in the modern world can be wide and varied, ranging from the ability to construct valuable tools to the ability to entertain the rest of the pack through song or storytelling. This holds especially true in Shili's growing urban areas, where keen minds can be more valuable than strong arms. \n\n[P]Most Togrutas consider excessive expressions of individuality to be a sign of social deviance. Yet in many instances, this same deviation is rewarded. as distinctive individuals can rise to positions of authority within Togrutas communities. Some outsiders have observed that the willingness for Togruta culture to excuse individuality generally depends on how successful and valuable those individuals are to the greater whole. If independent-minded Togrutas cannot succeed among their peoples, they tend to travel off-world, where they may find the attitudes of the wider galaxy more accepting. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Shili is in the Expansion Region, located near the Hydian Way. Shili's natural environment features many scrublands and dense, canopied forests. Both feature the red-and-white-colored turu-grass, which matches a Togruta's natural coloration. The world's wildlife includes a broad range of prey animals and other predators, including the savage akul. In the past, whole tribes of Togrutas frequently worked together to overcome prey and then proudly incorporated portions of their kills into their wardrobes. \n\n[P]However, many Togrutas have traveled off-world to establish colonies in the years since they became aware of wider galactic society. Freed from some of the traditions of their homeworld, these Togruta colonies have developed wildly different cultural paths. The artisan colony of Kiros, for example, focuses on nurturing creative expression and peaceful coexistence, along with a higher level of individuality among its citizens. Colonial Togrutas can thus differ greatly in outlook and attitudes from their cousins on Shili. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Togrutas were members of the Old Republic for thousands of years. While all speak the native tongue of Togruti, most also speak Basic. Togruti incorporates trills, which have varied meanings depending upon tremors from a speakers head-tails.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Pack Instincts : When performing the assist maneuver, Togrutas grant [BOOST][BOOST] instead of [BOOST].</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"TOGRUTA"}},"_id":"EqRSkZ9G9mkZfXet"}
{"name":"Drabatan","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/DRABATAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Drabatan[h4]\nMusic-obsessed amphibious humanoids, Drabatans come from the freshwater swamps of Pipada. Drabatans are renowned performers, often touring the galaxy on the strength of their skills. Their passionate nature includes a penchant for protest, which resulted in disaster when criticism of the Emporer went too far. Imperial reprisals since have been harsh.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Drabatans are amphibious humanoids with grey-green skin, small dark eyes, and a massive mouth. They stand slightly shorter than humans. They are excellent swimmers (though they strongly dislike salt water) and dine on a variety of insects, fish, and algae. To reproduce, Drabatans lay eggs that hatch tadpoles in silty pond soil. Over the course of a year, the tadpoles grow and assume bipedal features before emerging as child-sized Drabatans. They also develop large lungs and strong diaphragms, which enable them to achieve powerful vocals while singing or shouting.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Drabatans are a passionate species dedicated to the performing arts, especially song. Critics describe their music as hauntingly beautiful and insist that Drabatan music requires no translation for anyone to appreciate the ethereal, melancholy tones. Performance troupes throughout the galaxy, particularly Rodian Theater and Mon Cala Opera troupes, count Drabatans, who often play the heel, among their number. Drabatan voices are pitch-perfect, and many beings consider seeing a live performance of the Pipada Symphony Chamber Chorus to be life changing.\n[P]Song is firmly entrenched throughout everyday Drabatan life, in areas ranging from entertainment to education. Drabatan families have unique songs that detail their lineage and history, often performed at gatherings by the family's best vocalist and rearranged for the occasion. School curriculum teach everything through song, and students use jingles as mnemonic devices to help with memorization.\n[P]Drabatan culture values free artistic expression and opposes censorship. It is said that the only thing a Drabatan likes more than a song is a cause. Drabatans can be found at protest marches across the galaxy, often leading chants. Their political views have aligned them ideologically with Alderaan and Chandrila, which has created tension under Imperial rule.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Swamps, bogs, and marshes cover Pipada, making it a warm and humid paradise for acclimated species like the Hutts, Shawda Ubbs, and native Drabatans. Most denizens of Pipada live in single-family homes built in trees, perched on stilts, or floating in ponds. The largest lakes host cities featuring massive towers with fountains plunging deep into the lake bed. Some of the towers support luxurious skyhooks. Anchored to downtown towers are endless strings of bobbing buoy-buildings housing a variety of shops. The are beneath the lake surface is just as busy as that above, and most buildings have entrances both above and below the water.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Satirists and artists love Drabatese for its clever ability to combine small words and syllables to form large unwieldy words with multilayered ideas and very specific meanings. The language itself is difficult to write, as sonic volume determines much of subtext and grammar. When necessary, Drabatans have a simpler, quieter language that utilizes their vocal pouches to emit croaks of varying pitch. Drabatans can also speak Basic and other languages commonly used in the performing arts.\n[P][B]Life under the Empire:[b] Most Drabatans are musicians or actors, or in related fields. Many also pursue careers in politics or advertising, leaning on their gift for strong oration. Since the Empire's crackdown on Pipada, though, many Drabatans have joined resistance groups, using their loud voices to croak battle orders instead of sing.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Charm : Drabatan may start the game with one rank in Charm.</p><p>Big Noise : When making a Leadership or Coercion check, Drabatans can spend [AD][AD] to affect one additional character not originally targeted by the check or affect targets at one range band further than normal.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 93 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"DRABATAN"}},"_id":"G0PrWzwDrp3nAKcx"}
{"name":"Noghri","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/NOGHRI.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Noghri[h4]\n\nThe only remaining sentients native to the planet Honoghr in the Outer Rim, the Noghri are a fierce, bipedal, humanoid species. Their physical stature and lack of social graces, including a sense of humor, has led many to dismiss them as primitive, and as such, they are often underestimated.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Noghri have distinct physical features that allow them to be easily differentiated from the other denizens of the galaxy. They are hairless, gray or blue-skinned, and usually grow to be no more than 1.4 meters in height. Their faces are accentuated by a large sloping forehead that ends in a pronounced crest of bone just above their black eyes; this has the effect of causing their eyes to be deep-set. Though generally having the ability to completely cover their teeth with their lips, most Noghri have fangs that protrude from their mouths to some degree. Their clawed hands are another of their more prominent features.\n\n[P]Perhaps one of the most significant characteristics they possess, the Noghri's sense of smell is unlike any other species in the galaxy. It is said that their sense of smell is so acute that they are even able to distinguish among the bloodlines of other sentient beings by scent alone.\n\n[P]Due to the difficulties of life on Honoghr, their bodies have evolved to be lithe and muscular, which provides them not only great strength, but also quick reflexes. This combination of strength and reflexes has allowed the Noghri to become fearsome hunters and deadly warriors.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Noghri society is clan based; each member is fiercely loyal to its clan and honor has a preeminent role in their culture. Each clan seems to be born out of the extended family and, as such, has a matriarch who leads the clan and maintains its history through written and oral tradition. Though there are numerous clans, the most notable are Clan Bakh'tor, Clan Baikh'vair, Clan Eikh'mir, Clan Khim'bar, Clan Hakh'khar, and Clan Tlakh'sar.\n\n[P]Loyalty is also another significant aspect of Noghri culture. It is not uncommon for them to sacrifice themselves for their charge if they happen to be bodyguards or to willingly go to their deaths against the enemies of those who they have pledged their allegiance.\n\n[P]As warriors and hunters, most Noghri on Honoghr still prefer hand-held weapons such as knives, spears and other \"primitive\" weapons due to the fact that they like being up-close-and-personal with their kills. Unlike those who remain on their home world, Noghri who travel throughout the galaxy have also adapted themselves to the use of all manner of warfare technologies from blasters to grenades; as often as not, though, they can still be seen engaging enemies in hand-to-hand combat, armed with either a knife, vibroblade, or merely their claws. Additionally, due to their natural ability of stealthiness, they make excellent assassins and special-forces troops.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] For generations Noghri have been struggling to survive on the infertile surface of Honoghr, which was scarred and polluted by the poisonous fallout of a battle in orbit. During that conflict, a Lucrehulk-class Core ship, carrying the Trihexalophine1138 toxin on board, crashed into the planet's southern pole. The toxin killed most of the planet's flora, as well as millions of Noghri. To make matters worse, the surface was bombarded countless times by ordinary ship fire and the wildfires they sparked continued to burn off the poisoned plant life for months.\n\n[P]As a direct result of these events Honoghr attained a green-brownish color when viewed from space -- reflecting its dead terrain. In the southern hemisphere there remains a green region known as the \"clean land\". It became a home for the surviving Noghri following the catastrophe as they settled along the region's borders and cultivated its interior. Before the ecological disaster the Clean Land had been a neutral location for the various Noghri clans where they could discuss matters without worrying about inter-clan rivalries.\n\n[P]In the subsequent decades, natural processes and the efforts of the natives have worked to restore much of the Honoghr's surface. The gradual regrowth has resulted in juvenile forests, swamps and jungles appearing in areas which were once completely inhospitable. The majority of these have taken root near the large ocean which crosses the equator while the planet's capital, open to foreign visitors, lies in its cold and arid north.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The languages spoken most frequently by Noghri are their native tongue, Honoghran (sometimes called Noghrese) and Basic. Noghri who speak Basic almost always speak in soft, whispered, chilling voices.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Concealment : Noghri may remove all [SETBACK] imposed due to concealment against a target that is within Short Range.</p><p>Claws and Teeth : When a Noghri makes a\n            Brawl check to deal damage to an opponent,\n            their attack deals +1 point of damage and has\n            a Crit Rating of 3.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Brawl":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"NOGHRI"}},"_id":"GoEymAh3jqE3tddq"}
{"name":"Skakoan","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/SKAKOAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Skakoan[h4]\nAlthough it is a Core World, Skako remained disconnected from the Republic for millennia for several reasons. Skako's high-pressure methane atmosphere has proven uncomfortable at best, and deadly at worst, to the majority of the galaxy's life forms. Likewise, physical participation in galactic culture requires Skakoans to wear hardened encounter suits. These challenges reinforced the Skakoans' cultural tendencies toward xenophobia and isolationism.\n[P]While the galaxy spun around them, the Skakoans developed a sophisticated civilization, harnessing the power of their atmosphere, improving their technology, and covering their planet with industry. Although members of the species possess a wide variety of interests and professions, the Skakoans most willing to venture from their homeworld-even if only to nearby Skako Minor-have tended to be technological industrialists. This has established Skakoans in the galactic eye as a technologically obsessed species. \n[P]The stereotype has a measure of truth to it. The massive planetwide city on Skako requires constant maintenance and improvement, and these industrialists have seen an opportunity to trade for technologies and sciences to bring back to Skako. Overcoming their reluctance to deal with outsiders, they have invested in companies, negotiated limited trade with their homeworld, and maneuvered themselves in to executive positions at various organizations, most notably in the Techno Union.\n[P]However, industrialist Skakoans originally avoided membership in the Republic, preferring not to deal with Senate representation or political shenanigans. Homebound Skakoans didn't care who or what empire or government controlled the surrounding systems as long as Skako was left alone, and the industrialists felt that technology and industry knew no political borders. This changed when Wat Tambor rose up the ranks of the Techno Union, eventually serving as its foreman and representative in the Galactic Senate, thus becoming the de facto representative of Skako.\n[P]The onset of the Clone Wars changed Skako's political attitudes rapidly. Unaware of the Sith manipulations, Wat Tambor and other Skakoan business interests sided with the Separatists, fearing Republic overreach. Although the Techno Union had officially declared neutrality, Wat Tambor directly and Skako indirectly provided support to the Separatists. Tambor's expansionist leanings turned the Republic against Skako, and upon his assassination and the dissolution of the Separatists, the Empire inherited the prejudice.\n[P]Currently, the Empire has Skako under emigration restriction, and the majority of Skakoans prefer being cut off from the galaxy. A few think their people have learned the wrong lessons from the failures of Wat Tambor. Instead of withdrawing from galactic participation, they want Skakoans, not the Empire, to decide the fate of their homeworld and citizens.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Thin in build, Skakoans have pale skin in folds, little facial or body hair, nasal slits, and toothless mouths. While they ingest liquid food, Skakoans can sustain their metabolism with atmospheric methane if it remains the proper pressure. For this reason, Skakoans can't simply use a rebreather like the Gand; they require a fully pressurized suit. Other than the pressurized methane requirement, Skakoans resemble humans in physiological matters. They have roughly the same lifespan and the same biological issues in health, reproduction, and old age.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Logic and mathematics dominate the discourse on Skako , but its people remain highly emotional and passionate. Outsiders mistake them to be a robotic species due to their pressure suits and translator units. Skakoans see no contradictions between emotion and logic, though even they admit that their fear of the galaxy is partially irrational.\n[P]Skako's environment doesn't welcome outsiders. Even other methane breathers find the pressure uncomfortable. Skakoans find existence offworld equally uncomfortable, and the need for hardened pressure suits naturally causes them to see the galaxy as a dangerous and hostile place. This xenophobia extends to visitors to the planet, who must wear their own pressure suits.\n[P]Despite this difficulty, or perhaps because of it, Skakoans formed galactic companies such as Baktoid Armor Workshop, placing their headquarters on Skako, forcing outsiders to adjust to Skako's environment while living on the planet. This practice eventually led the Techno Union to do the same.\n[P]The logistical difficulties of living on Skako have given Skakoans an interesting perspective on technology. While some species think technology invasive or in opposition to the natural world. Skakoans see technology as necessary, essential, and an evolution of nature. Methane being a plentiful and powerful fuel source, metallic resources abundant, and oxygen a controllable and useful waste product (although a flammable toxin), machines and industry are a natural and inevitable end result of their intelligence.\n[P]Skakoans practice a mystery religion that is led by the Elders of the Power Mounds. Rising in the ranks of the religion allows them access to the holy site and contact with mystic artifacts. The religion bases itself on belief in the existence of an alternate dimension and the mythical creature living within it. Whether or not this creature exists or if the Elders can travel to this dimension is known only to the Elders and a select few.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Much like Coruscant, Skako hosts a planetwide city, or ecumenopolis, demonstrating its advanced technological civilization. With rich resources, especially of methane and metals, the Skakoans have had plenty with which to build and experiment. Due to solar radiation striking the dense atmosphere, though, the upper layers of the atmosphere are an alkaline haze. This limited astronomical science until the development of low orbital flight.\n[P]With a lack of cultural desire to explore the stars, the Skakoans focused on managing their planet, covering their homeworld with an ecumenopolis much earlier than other civilizations. Their interstellar neighbors ignored the planet, thinking it uninhabitable and dangerous to explore. Any power signatures they detected, they attributed to methane flares. Only when the Skakoans ventured beyond their hazy atmospheric borders did the galaxy take notice. Still, because of Skakoan xenophobia and personal secrecy about their lives and homeworld, few outsiders know much about Skako or its people.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Skakoans speak their native Skakoverbal, a complex language that shares similarities with Binary. Most Skakoans don't learn Basic, since few venture offworld. Those who do travel abroad tend to rely on language translation modules attached to their heavy pressure suits, adding to the myth that the Skakoans are cybernetic or machine beings. Again, due to the complexity of Skakoverbal, translation modules often spit out junk sounds when compressing down to simpler languages. Technology has been such a prominent part of their lives that the current symbol set of their written language, Skakoform, resembles circuitry.\n[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b] The Skakoans have suffered greatly at the hands of the Empire. Once the Confederacy of Independent Systems fell, the Republic quickly turned toward sanctioning Skako. When the Republic became the Empire, the Skakoans found themselves shunned as enemies of the Emperor. Most are content, or at least willing, to remain on their planet with the Empire watching from the skies above.\n[P]The ones who have joined the Rebel Alliance know that hiding from the galaxy won't save them or their homeworld. Still, living among low-pressure oxygen breathers is isolating, and the heavy pressure suits increase their distance from their peers. These difficulties serve to heighten Rebel Skakoans' militancy. They are willing to sacrifice breath, touch, and their xenophobia to work with outsiders, and every moment the Empire remains standing is a moment away from home.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Methane Breather : Skakoans start the game with a Skakoan Pressure Suit.</p><p>Methane Breather : Skakoans treat standard planetary air and pressure as a corrosive atmosphere with rating 6.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 21 - Fully Operational[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true},"Education":{"mod":"Education","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Mechanics":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SKAKOAN"}},"_id":"IZaOSPPrTvFZFQUG"}
{"name":"Mikkian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/MIKKIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Mikkian[h4]\nMikkians are a diverse species characterized by a variety of bright skin tones and elaborate crests of head-tendrils. These tendrils are remarkable not only for their appearance, but because they are highly sophisticated and effective sensory organs. Each Mikkian's head-tendrils are unique, and vary greatly in appearance. This has led to many misconceptions among others as to what a \"typical\" Mikkian looks like.\n[P]Mikkians are known for their loyalty and sense of personal honor and accountability. Sentients who work or fight alongside them quickly come to value Mikkian allies. These traits have been particularly valued among military organizations and the old Jedi Order.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Mikkians exhibit a variety of bright colors in their skin pigmentation, with various reds and pinks, blues, greens, and yellows being relatively common. Coloration varies greatly even among closely related Mikkians, and more often than not, siblings or parents and children are completely different colors. Mikkians' features are typical of most humanoid species, with the notable exception of a lack of ears and the presence of motile head-tendrils.\n[P]Even more distinctive than their skin tones is the seemingly endless variety in Mikkians' head-tendrils. No two sets are identical; they vary in both number and form, to the extent that many outsiders are surprised to learn any two Mikkians are of the same species. Head-tendrils range from fanlike crests and tape-like ribbons to cylindrical tentacles and membranous fins. Some taper from a broad base to a thin tip, while others are consistent, and they vary in length from a few centimeters up to nearly a half-meter. The number of tendrils on a Mikkian's head similarly ranges from only a handful to dozens.\n[P]Regardless of their appearance, all Mikkians' head-tendrils are motile. The exact nature of the movement varies with the form of the tendrils but is usually fluid and nearly constant. Tendril movement is largely involuntary, and primarily a function of the tendrils' sensory capabilities. However, some Mikkians learn to exert a degree of control. The motions of tendrils can broadcast clues to a Mikkian's emotional state in much the same way as facial expressions and other body language, although only fellow Mikkians or outsiders who are very familiar with the species would be able to identify these tells.\n[P]Mikkians' head-tendrils serve an important function beyond the superficial. Despite their endless variety, all head-tendrils contain elaborate networks of sensitive nerves, which constantly gather information through a variety of means. Most importantly, the tendrils detect vibrations, particularly sound waves, and so allow Mikkians to hear in much the same fashion as do other species' ears. In fact, Mikkian head-tendrils are vastly more sophisticated than the auditory organs of most humanoid species and additionally detect such information as humidity, temperature, magnetic direction, and more with an impressive degree of accuracy. Mikkian head-tendrils even detect radiation to the extent that they can \"see\" light and dark, although Mikkians' eyes remain their primary visual sense organs.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Mikkian culture prizes integrity and kinship. To most Mikkians, loyalty to family and comrades is the highest value, though their sense of honor encompasses much more. Mikkians respect honesty. and generally resort to duplicity only in the most extreme situations. Mikkian forthrightness can come across to other sentients as blunt or even rude, while Mikkians sometimes have a hard time adjusting to the more flexible views of other species.\n[P]The Mikkian code of honor applies to all things, but particularly matters of warfare. After all, in nothing else are the consequences so severe. Mikkian culture respects warrior traditions, but values discipline and honor over physical power or even victory. This, along with Mikkia's strong spiritual tradition, explains why Mikkian society always had a highly favorable opinion of the Jedi Order. For a child to join the Jedi was among the greatest of accomplishments, and brought considerable honor and esteem to an entire family.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Mikkia is a verdant world located in the Expansion Region. Their homeworld is as diverse as the Mikkians themselves, with an astoundingly wide range of biospheres and climes. Mikkia is home to both icy poles and sweltering equatorial jungles, to deep oceans and arid deserts, to towering mountain ranges and vast plains. Some scholars even theorize that this environmental variety might have contributed to the physical variance among Mikkians.\n[P]Mikkia was a part of the Republic for thousands of years, and still held a seat in the Galactic Senate at its dissolution. Since the rise of the Empire, Mikkia's role on the galactic stage has suffered. The destruction of the Jedi Order contributed to a high level of anti-Imperial sentiment on the planet. The resulting increase in Imperial scrutiny has only fostered further resentment, and Mikkians' tendency to speak truthfully on matters of great concern has led to many tragic outcomes.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Mikkian language is a melodic, flowing tongue characterized by soft sounds and subtle intonations. Mikkian words tend to flow one into another, and for nonspeakers, it can be difficult to tell where one word ends and another begins. Most Mikkians take pride in the beauty of their spoken language but have no qualms about learning and using Basic to communicate with others. Distinct dialects of Mikkian from the ancient past persist even today, and on rare occasions lead to communication difficulties or awkward misunderstandings between Mikkians of different regions and families.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] There exists a long history of the Force on Mikkia. Belief in the Force plays an important part in Mikkian religious traditions, and Force sensitives have often found a place in the priesthood, even during the time of the Jedi. Since the rise of the Empire, Mikkian spirituality has been a source of some trouble for the species, particularly since Mikkians are largely unwilling to hide or alter their beliefs to placate Imperial observers.\n[P]A positive view of the Jedi persists on Mikkia. Mikkians continue to honor the memory of ancestors and family who joined the Jedi. Lingering questions about the destruction of the order and the Empire's attempts to erase its legacy contribute to the strong anti-Imperial attitudes that prevail among Mikkians. Two decades of Imperial propaganda can scarcely sweep away millennia of cultural memory.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Sensory Tendrils : Mikkians add [BO] to all Perception checks they make.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 20 - Knights of Fate[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Discipline":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Boost","value":1}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"MIKKIAN"}},"_id":"JPGgF4b4hVMLS76w"}
{"name":"Sullustan","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/SULLUSTAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Sullustan[h4]\n\nBorn underground but with a yearning for the stars, most Sullustans find their way into space as pilots and astrogators. Affable, curious, and free-spirited, Sullustans are not fond of the Empire, and even less fond of the fact that the corporatocracy that runs their government from the offices of SoroSuub has sold their entire planet to the Imperial war machine. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Despite their very distinctive features, Sullustans are genetically near-humans. Their skin is generally pink in tone, with very little body hair. Their height tends to fall within 1.0 to 1.8 meters. They have large, dark eyes; large, rounded ears; and notable flaps of skin that extend down from their cheeks and are called \"dewflaps.\" \n\n[P]Evolving on a volcanic planet with a thoroughly inhospitable surface, the Sullustans became subterranean beings who thrived in the caves and tunnels beneath Sullust's unstable outer crust. Their adaptations give them exceptional hearing, including the ability to determine distances and directions via audio cues. Their eyes are such that they can see up to twenty meters even in total darkness. Unfortunately, this means most Sullustans start to suffer serious corneal damage when exposed to natural light over extended periods of time. \n\n[P]Another evolutionary adaptation enables all Sullustans to always know what direction they are going, regardless of conditions or lack of physical signs. This ability allows the species to navigate the complex warrens and tunnel networks they live in. For reasons not yet fully understood, this natural direction sense in any situation extends all the way to space travel, even including hyperspace navigation. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Sullustans have a very clan-oriented culture, in which a single female has many male mates, and the group lives together and raises the children. Females grow to a certain maturity, after which they go on to find their own group of males with which to start another family group (called a \"warren-clan\"). The Sullustans have a polytheistic religion, and they revere death as the \"Eternal Sleep.\" They maintain massive and elaborate vaults as holy sites, which are quite beautiful. \n\n[P]Though most Sullustans stay close to home, those seeking adventure and new experiences found themselves able to parlay their natural sense of direction into lucrative jobs as spacers throughout the galaxy. These spacers learned a great deal, especially about technology and manufacturing, which they brought home with them to share with their people. Eventually, the extremely lucrative mining found on Sullust and its moons financed a huge boom in the Sullustese economy, which came to be dominated by the highly diversified SoroSuub Corporation. Employing over half the population, SoroSuub ultimately engineered circumstances allowing it to take over the government of the planet; at first, this was behind the scenes, but with the rise of the Empire, it became a legal fact as well. \n\n[P]Sullustans are naturally friendly and outgoing, enjoying practical jokes as a way to see how others react.

{"name":"Verpine","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/VERPINE.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Verpine[h4]\n\nVerpine are an insectoid sentient species from the Roche asteroids. Best known for their technological aptitude, the Verpine are considered to be among the finest starship engineers in the galaxy.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Verpine are thin bipedal insectoids, standing 1.9 meters tall on average. Unlike many insectoids, including the Kibnon to which they are distantly related, the Verpine have only four limbs (two arms and two legs), though there are instances of Verpine growing vestigial wings. Their heads are dominated by large compound eyes. They also have two antennae, one located behind each eye. Their hardened carapace, composed of a green chitinous substance called carahide, is as flexible as the skin of other creatures, yet tough enough to deflect a blade or even absorb a glancing blaster bolt. The Verpine circulatory system does not contain a heart — at least, not an organ which Human physiologists would identify as a heart.\n\n[P]Verpine eyes are keen enough to pick out microscopic details. Their antennae contain tympanic nerves which pick up sound. Their antennae are also sensitive to radio waves, giving Verpine the natural ability to sense and transmit radio waves to communicate with another Verpine in their language over distances on the order of one hundred kilometers. Some observers mistake this nearly instant, silent communication for true telepathy. Thanks to their natural radio communication network, their colonies are run as a consensus democracy, with all Verpine instantly consulted on questions affecting the hive. Given their reliance on radio communication, Verpine frequently suffer negative consequences when their antenna are damaged. \n\n[P]Verpine come in two types—intelligent, hermaphroditic Verpine and unintelligent worker drones. At the time of their entrance into Galactic society, only five percent of Verpine were intelligent, but the demands of technological civilization required the Verpine to restructure their society. After the change, egg-laying Verpine use a special enzyme to ensure all eggs laid develop into intelligent Verpine. Any drones needed by a Verpine hive are produced via cloning.\n\n[P]When a Verpine hive need more members, some of the fertile Verpine will be asked to lay eggs, while others will be assigned to fertilize them. The eggs are cared for in colony incubators, and hatchlings are cared for by the entire hive.\n\n[P]While hermaphrodite, there is evidence to indicate that individual Verpine have definite genders, either permanently or at some point of their existences. \n\n[P]The fungus Magenge, which grows inside the asteroid colonies of the Verpine, form the basis of the Verpine diet.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Verpine have variable naming customs. Some have single names such as Fxz'et, Zix, Ss's, or Moegid. Others have first and last names such as Kuli Ned'lx, Kyli Ned'Ix, or Osos Niskooen. Many, though not all, Verpine names contain sibilant consonants and glottal stops.\n\n[P]Verpines are also known to make highly sought after weapons such as the Verpine shatter gun, the Verpine headband, and the Verpine prototype shield.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Roche asteroid field, sometimes known simply as Roche, is a series of asteroids colonized by the Verpine, including Nickel One (the capital), Slayn, Korpil, Roche G42, and Shantipole.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Verpine is the native language of the Verpine species from Roche asteroid field.\n\n[P]Although Verpine language is usually spoken, Verpine can also use radio waves to communicate with other Verpine in their language.\n\n[P]Most Verpine are fluent in both Verpine language and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Microscopic Sight : Verpine add [ADVANTAGE] to all Perception checks.</p><p>Chitin Plating : Verpine have a natural defense of 1.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Mechanics":{"mod":"Mechanics","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"VERPINE"}},"_id":"JmpP9IcRGYmydAr1"}
{"name":"Kubaz","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/KUBAZ.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Kubaz[h4]\nDistinguished by their long snout and green-black skin as well as the whirling trill of their native tongue, the Kubaz flit from shadow to shadow. Their sensitive eyes observe what remains unseen by less perceptive species. Consummate pragmatists, the few Kubaz who travel beyond their homeworld of Kubindi do what is necessary to survive the dangers of life in Palpatine's regime. Keen senses and a willingness to set aside moral obligations that burden other species cement their place as some of the most sought-after spies and informants on all sides of the Galactic Civil War.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The most distinctive trait of the Kubaz is the long snout that dominates their face. Contrary to common galactic perceptions, their sense of smell is no keener than that of most species. Instead, this snout is a natural evolution of the Kubaz and their unique insectivore diet. Kubaz are passionate about their food, making little distinction between common insects and sentient insectoids. This often leads to tension between Kubaz and insectoid species such as Geonosians, Melittos, and Verpine. \n[P]Most Kubaz keep their coarse hair cut short, its dark color accenting their green-black skin. Those traveling offworld typically wear protective lenses or goggles to shield their sensitive eyes, which are quite keen from generations of living in the twisting hive caverns of their homeworld. Contrary to what one might assume due to their strange appearance, Kubaz are mammalian, with body proportions and lifespans similar to those of humans. \n[P][B]Society:[b] Countless densely populated clans of Kubaz live in the winding caverns that burrow deep beneath the surface of Kubindi. These clans engaged in generations of tribal wars over the harvesting of the hives of the great insects that serve as their primary food source. Finally, through selective breeding and genetic manipulation, each clan was able to distinguish its insectoid livestock from that of neighboring clans. This led to a longstanding peace, which holds to this day. Diplomacy, cooperation, and the exchange of information accompanied this peaceful resolution, giving rise to general prosperity and scientific advancement. Before long, the Kubaz began exploring nearby planets in spacecraft considered primitive by galactic standards. Their starships were incapable of hyperspace travel, though particularly adventurous Kubaz began to establish colonies on several moons in the Ku'Bakai system. \n[P]Because the Kubaz never formally joined the Republic, they remained relatively unscathed during the horrors of the Clone Wars. By the time the Empire rose to power, the Kubaz had only recently developed ships capable of hyperspace travel. This cemented their place as a species in galactic society. Unfortunately, it would be the last great achievement of the Kubaz. The Empire saw little value in the Ku'Bakai system or its natives and looked the other way as they were claimed as the property of Hutt Space. Warring Hutt kajidics enticed Kubaz into their services with promises of wealth and power. The Kubaz, realizing the need to quickly adapt to the highly advanced galactic society beyond their native star system, readily accepted offers from Nar Shaddaa and other Hutt stronghold worlds. \n[P]Ever the pragmatists, the Kubaz now make every effort to ingratiate themselves with the highest bidder, and they have quickly proven themselves invaluable information brokers. The morality of working for ruthless gangsters and alongside hired killers matters little to them. They have survived the scorching heat of their homeworld and generations of civil war. The Kubaz respect survival and the ability to quietly endure above all things. As such, they make few judgments (even among their own people) about the actions and choices of other individuals. In fact, ethical questions and discussions about morality are considered to be a strange luxury reserved for other species. That is not to say that the Kubaz are malicious or perform evil acts for their own sake. They simply respect that each task put before an individual needs to be solved efficiently in order to advance in a given situation. Whether one's employer is a Hutt crime lord, Imperial officer, or Rebel spy is of no concern. Each day reveals new secrets to a clever Kubaz, and each new secret is an opportunity to be exploited. \n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Located in the Outer Rim, Kubindi is a world burnt by its own sun. Great flares leap from its blue star and devastate the planet's surface, making the planet uninhabitable to all but the hardiest of species. Most of its surface is dominated by blackened mountain ranges and seas of endless, windswept sand. Sandstorms can arise in an instant, choking the life out of any creature caught out in the open. Only swarms of massive carnivorous insects dare live aboveground, burrowing into the arid wasteland when the storms appear. Many natives regard these dangerous beasts as a delicacy. Clan rulers regularly hire hunting parties to brave the planet's surface in an effort to recover them alive to be served as gourmet fare. The Kubaz dwell in tunnels so deep as to almost reach the planet's core. In the pitch black far beneath the surface of Kubindi, they raise crops of genetically modified and marked insect larvae, which are a staple of the Kubaz diet and a necessity for survival. \n[P]Few offworld traders visit Kubindi, as it has little to offer the galactic market and remains under the protection of the Hutts. However, some of the moons of the Ku'Bakai system have established colonies that host clans of Kubaz. These outposts are hotbeds of information and illicit secrets. Due to the presence of the Hutts, however, it is difficult to separate truth from rumor, both of which pass freely between whispering travelers and pragmatic natives. \n[P][B]Language:[b] Though most Kubaz understand Basic, they are unable to speak it. Their native tongue, Kubazian, is subtle and complex, combining shrill squeaks and whistles with the almost imperceptible snout motions so common among the Kubaz. Very few outsiders are capable of speaking Kubazian, but those who do earn a measure of respect for their efforts. \n[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b] Kubaz who join the Rebellion are rarely idealists. Instead, they recognize that both the Hutts and the Empire offer false promises and oppression to their people. This makes the Alliancean unlikely but logical choice. Their sharp senses and unwavering commitment to whatever task is set before them makes Kubaz natural spies, infiltrators, and assassins. These traits make them particularly suitable for performing many of the necessary but morally questionable missions that more idealistic freedom fighters are loathe to undertake.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Stealth : Kubaz may begin the game with one free rank in Stealth.</p><p>Enhanced Vision : When making Ranged combat or Perception checks, Kubaz may remove up to [SE][SE] imposed due to concealment or applicable environmental factors (but not defense).</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 20 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"KUBAZ"}},"_id":"KHbGZMrQz8d6dzjp"}
{"name":"Wookiee","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/WOOK.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Wookies[h4]\n\nStrong, intelligent, and fierce in battle, Wookiees make the best of friends for those to whom they are loyal—and the worst of enemies for anyone to whom they are not. Unfortunately, Wookiees have virtually disappeared from the population at large and are becoming a faded memory of the Old Republic. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Averaging over two meters in height, Wookiees strike fear into the hearts of their opponents because of their sheer size. There is good reason to be scared; few other species in the galaxy match either the strength of a Wookiee or the depths of a Wookiee's temper. Their limbs are long, with retractable claws on their fingers and toes for the arboreal environment of their homeworld. These claws are only used for climbing, never for combat, as such an act is seen as dishonorable in Wookiee culture. Their fur grows in a variety of colors, becoming darker in middle age and then graying or whitening in later years (Wookiees can live for centuries). \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Although their physique makes for an intimidating appearance, Wookiees live by strict codes of honor and loyalty. Friendship and family bonds knit Wookiees tightly together, for there are dangers on Kashyyyk that frighten even the most ferocious Wookiee. Kilometers-tall wroshyr trees cover nearly half of Kashyyyk's surface, defining the world's unique ecology and serving as homes for most Wookiee communities. On the seventh level of these forests, Wookiees have built immense cities in the trees, blending technology in harmony with the environment. Mechanical skills and engineering come naturally to the Wookiees.\n\n[P]Having dominated much of Kashyyyk's upper levels, the Wookiees were on the path to explore the stars on their own when a neighboring species, the Trandoshans, arrived on Kashyyyk to colonize and exploit the world. Even though the Trandoshans had more advanced weaponry, the Wookiees fought the would-be colonizers off the planet. The Wookiees wasted no time in disassembling the technology Trandoshans left behind. This included a starship with sublight engines. When the Trandoshans returned, the Wookiees drove them away for a second time, then took flight to the stars. \n\n[P]The Wookiee-Trandoshan wars continued in spats throughout the later years of the Old Republic, with the Republic mediators usually siding with the honorable Wookiees. The Trandoshans saw an opportunity, however, when Palpatine declared his Empire. They sent emissaries to Palpatine to recount their grievances against the Wookiees. The Imperials heeded Trandoshan advice and placed the cantankerous Wookiees in labor camps. Wookiee children were held at gunpoint unless Wookiee adults used their technical expertise to build Imperial war material, which included parts of the Death Stars.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Wookiees hail from the forest world of Kashyyyk. This world is dominated by immense old-growth forests, including the kilometers-tall wroshyr trees. These trees form a layered ecology on Kashyyyk, with the uppermost levels being the safest. The deeper one travels into the Kashyyyk forests, the more dangerous flora and fauna one finds. At the lowest depths, even a Wookiee cannot survive for long. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Shyriiwook, the Wookiee tongue, continues to amaze scholars with the incredible nuances of grunts and growls that form the language. Few non-Wookiees can speak it or its dialects, like Xaczik, spoken by the Wookiees of the Wartaki Islands. Conversely, Wookiee physiology prevents them from speaking the languages of other species, including Basic, though most Wookiees have no problem comprehending them.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Rages when Wounded : When a Wookiee has suffered any wounds, he deals +1 damage to Brawl and Melee attacks.

{"name":"Gossam","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/GOSSAM.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Gossam[h4]\n\nA small species of reptilian origin, Gossams have exerted a greater influence on galactic history than their slender frames might suggest. Gossams have a reputation for being unable to resist a profitable venture, such as prominent colonies and even pirate fleets. In a move that turned out to be spectacularly unprofitable, the Gossam leader of the Republic's Commerce Guild secretly colluded with the Confederacy of Independent Systems in the Separatist crisis, but the Gossam species weathered the fallout more easily than other Separatist allies. The Empire's retribution was typically indiscriminate, but the Gossams' natural independence and diversified interests weakened any attempts to pin consequences upon them. Gossams on their homeworld—Castell—were enslaved by the Empire, and the species was banned from setting foot on Coruscant. However, independent members of the species remain spread throughout the galaxy, waiting for the right moment to assert their interests. Many of these individuals—entrepreneurs, explorers, and members of a thousand other profes-sions—have thrown in their sympathy or resources with the Rebellion. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Although they rarely stand over 1.25 meters tall, Gossams have a striking appearance, with vivid yellow eyes and rugged, bumpy blue or green skin. Though they are short, their long necks and lithe forms lend them a semblance of greater height. Gossams move with an easy grace on three-toed feet, and their three-fingered hands are just as capable of fine manipulation as those of species with more digits. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] After a devastating economic depression that crippled their society, Gossams restructured their lives around the Republic's Commerce Guild. Initially, all Gossams were indentured to the Commerce Guild to pay off a debt for the stabilization of their homeworld, Castell. Their situation improved over time, but their society has retained the tradition of beginning adult life with a period of indenture in order to gain experience with the galaxy at large. \n\n[P]Of course, Gossams have never been great sticklers for tradition, so with the dissolution of the Commerce Guild and the Empire's seizure of Castell, few cultural factors remain to unify Gossams still at large in the galaxy. Their shrewd ability to avoid being pinned down defines them more than anything else.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Gossam homeworld of Castell is a heavily industrialized foundry world. Before the rise of the Empire, the production lines of Castell were a source of wealth and influence for the species, even if their exploitative indenture system kept the workers from receiving direct benefit. Castell produced virtually everything, including luxury goods, speeders, and even advanced starship components. Now, the Imperial occupation has forced Gossams to retool their manufacturing plants to produce the munitions and other tools of conquest that keep them oppressed. The indenture experienced in the years prior to the occupation pales in comparison to the grinding slave labor Imperial overseers now demand, and as long as the Empire stands, no end is in sight. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Gossam language, consisting primarily of croaking and trilling, is nearly impossible for other species to reproduce or understand, so most Gossams speak fluent Basic. The written form of Gossam is easier for other species to learn, and features a structure that links numerous small words to describe a larger concept. Thus, Gossams have a habit for wordy, verbose writing, even in Basic.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Small : Gossam are smaller than average and count as silhouette 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Desperate Allies[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GOSSAM"}},"_id":"NypLfYbsNjG19oE4"}

Also known as Utapauns and Ancients due to their long lifespans, they co-exist on Utapau with the Utai. The two species get along well, with the lanky Pau'ans assuming leadership roles on the planet. Though some view the Pau'ans as frightening, they are friendly, and are more than happy to welcome visitors to their little-known world. Due to Utapau's remoteness in the Outer Rim Territories, the Pau'ans were isolated for most of their history. However, they played a part in galactic events in 19 BBY, when the Confederacy of Independent Systems conquered Utapau. The Pau'ans opposed the Confederacy with the aid of the Republic, and later opposed the Empire, after Imperials took control of their planet following the Declaration of a New Order.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The average member of the sentient near-Human Pau'an, or Utapaun, as they are sometime called, species stand taller than a Human, at approximately 1.9 meters. They are bald and their head is striped with furrowed gray skin. Pau'ans weigh seventy kilograms on average. Pau'ans have large, sunken black eyes in red eye sockets and jagged, fang-like teeth used for tearing into raw meat, as they are carnivores. The species has pale, wrinkled skin, due to the fact that they live in the sinkholes of Utapau, giving them limited access to light. These traits cause some to view them as frightening. However, Pau'ans as a society are generally friendly, and are happy to welcome guests to their often overlooked world. Pau'ans have long lifespans, living up to 700 years, much longer than the Utai, the other species native to Utapau. This earned them the nickname of \"Ancients\". Members of the species are able to see well in darkness. Pau'ans have four fingers and toes, but are more mobile than they appeared. They often wear elaborate clothes intended to heighten their impressive stature.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Pau'ans fulfill most of the governmental and administrative duties on Utapau, as the Utai do not desire such work, serving as laborers instead. Most Pau'ans serve as leaders early in their lives, often managing teams of Utai laborers. This gives them experience that would be used later in their life. Pau'ans are kind leaders, and sympathetic to their subordinates. Each city on Utapau is controlled by a Master of Port Administration, a hereditary title reserved for Pau'ans. These administrators are assisted by advisory councils for making important decisions about their city, turning to the Utapauan Security Force when necessary. Each Administrator serves on the Utapauan Committee and oversees planetary governance. However the committee rarely makes crucial decisions, as the cities are able to function on their own most of the time.\n\n[P]Despite the many differences between the Pau'ans and the Utai, the two species are able to co-exist peacefully, although inhabitants of the different Utapaun cities often have conflicts due to philosophical differences. Still, these conflicts rarely develop into bloodshed, and it is more common for the cities to ignore each other. Each city has its own culture, and competition is fierce between the groups. However, they are able to cooperate when the situation necessitated it, such as during the Confederate invasion of the planet in 19 BBY.\n\n[P]Pau'an society is a blend of a variety of styles and cultures, borne from the ancient merger with the Utai. Built into the sinkhole walls, Pau'an settlements such as the Pau City spaceport are divided into different areas, each a mix of architectural styles and other-worldly design. They like art, and enjoy studying sculptures and finding ways to incorporate different artistic styles into their architecture. Pau'ans developed an industrial society, despite their seemingly primitive and natural image, though the Utai were the ones who actually did the hard work. The Utai did not mind, however, and collectively much preferred labor to positions of leadership. They are able to power their city by wind, harnessing it through massive windmills. Over ninety-nine percent of the planet's power comes from these windmills. Most Pau'ans ride living beasts like varactyls and dactillions instead of speeders. Pau'ans, as well as Utai, are known for their love for podracing.\n\n[P]Pau'ans represented 30%—or approximately 28.5 million—of Utapau's total population of 90 million inhabitants.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Utapau is an arid sinkhole world in the Utapau system of the Tarabba sector in the Outer Rim Territories. Utapau is the homeworld of the Pau'ans and the Utai, more commonly referred to collectively as Utapauns. These species live in the many giant sinkholes that dotted the planet's scrub-covered surface.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Utapese is the language of the Pau'ans on the planet Utapau. Most Pau'ans speak and are literate in both Utapese and Basic.

The species is well-known for its long history of violence, war, and slavery, which they view as a natural order of life. This contributes to the fact that the Zygerrians are feared across the galaxy.

They generally have sallow complexions and are physically strong, but some individuals suffer from obesity.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] A warlike species, the Zygerrians hold strength—both physical and mental—in great esteem, viewing it as a means to gain power and authority. They believe that it is the natural order of life for the strong to dominate the weak, so slavery is normal for the species, and a display of weakness can mean death or enslavement in their culture. Because of this, the species willingly cultivates an image as dangerous and unpredictable to discourage others from challenging them. This tactic works, and the Zygerrians are feared in spaceports across the galaxy, earning fame for their history of violence, piracy, slavery, and war. Despite all of that, they are still considered an advanced civilization. The species' natural physical strength is well-complemented by their mastery of various weapons, such as retractable shock whips. The Zygerrians utilize various creatures to travel on their homeworld, including the winged brezak creatures, which the Zygerrian royal guard use to patrol the ground for escaped slaves. In order to transfer slaves between planets, the species uses highly durable freighters. Each transport contains space for numerous enslaved individuals, yet only require one pilot to operate it. The Zygerrians are cunning, ensuring that they have the upper hand in any situation. They traditionally settle their differences with an unarmed fistfight.\n\n[P]The Zygerrian people are organized into clans and classes. They have a noble class, many members of which, despite their high status, pursue a career in the military. The Zygerrian Head of State is a monarch; female rulers hold the title of Queen. The center of the Zygerrian society, however, is the Zygerrian Slavers Guild that focuses on slave trade in the Outer Rim Territories. Founded centuries before the Clone Wars, the organization thrived in their territory, mostly due to its well-organized nature and the Galactic Republic's diffuse presence in the Outer Rim. Each Zygerrian slaver has to pay a yearly membership fee to join the Guild and is then allocated a patch of space in which to work. The size of that patch varies from one planet to an entire system, depending on the amount of money the slaver paid as his fee. Compared to other slaver organizations, the Zygerrians are considered \"honorable\" by the Twi'leks, who prefer them as slave masters, since the Zygerrians' approach to slaving reduced the damage it did to the Twi'lek society.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Zygerria is the homeworld of the near-Human Zygerrian species.  The planet experienced success during the thousands of years the Zygerrians maintained their slave labor industry, but after the Jedi cracked down on the slaving operations, it faded from glory. Slavery was brought up again when the Zygerrians collaborated with the Separatists during the Clone Wars.\n\n[P]During the Zygerrian Slave Empire's height, the population had fortresses and cities built on top of the mesas scattered throughout the planet, using slave labor. After the empire's collapse, these buildings remained impressive sights to tourists, bringing visitors even from Alderaan.\n\n[P]Aside from being a major slavery world, it hosts several podraces annually, which attracted large numbers of spectators.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Zygerrian primarily speak Galactic Basic Standard.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Coercion":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"ZYGERRIAN","loaded":false}}}
{"name":"Xexto","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/XEXTO.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Xexto[h4]\n\nThe Xexto are a wiry, six-limbed species of humanoids with tiny heads atop long necks. Thanks to Arkanian experimentation, the Xexto are the genetic progenitors of the Quermians, and seem to share evolutionary similarities to the Kaminoans. Xexto have an insatiable demand for adventure and excitement, and there is little in the galaxy considered more dangerous than a pair of bored Xexto. While some regard their courage as false bravado and pride, the Rebel Alliance is proud to count the Xexto among its ranks, and have honored many for valor, though often posthumously. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Xexto are a slight species with pale, chalky skin and lithe bodies that sprout six, spindly limbs, four of which Xexto use as arms. Their small, round heads sit atop long necks, and feature large dark eyes and tiny mouths. Their skin is pale and can be shaded yellow, green, purple, or blue. \n\n[P]The Xexto have two brains, with basic body functions under the purview of the head, and higher functions carried out in the chest. Their large, black eyes are well suited to seeing in dark forests and caves, and Xexto often wear tinted goggles to protect their eyes when in areas of harsh, direct sunlight. Their reflexes are incredibly sharp, and they are mentally resilient in the face of trauma. Predators once dominated their homeworld, which helped test and develop Xexto quickness and resilience for millennia. \n\n[P]While academic circles are familiar with the story of how Arkanian geneticists experimented on Xexto to create the Quermian species, there is a more recent, lesser-known theory postulated by a number of fringe researchers. Their theory suggests that early Kaminoan geneticists created the Xexto as laborers for Troiken's spice mines on behalf of ancient Hutts almost twenty-thousand years ago, and claim they have proof in the form of key Kaminoan markers present in Xexto DNA. They believe the Arkanians were only interested in the Xexto to gauge the Kaminoan threat to business. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Xexto primarily live in sprawling, technologically advanced arboreal villages throughout Troiken's forests; they have also constructed a number of modern cities and spaceports. Veterned is the capital, and consists of buildings and facilities inspired by Core World architecture akin to that found on Corellia. Intricate mosaics of blue, purple, green, and yellow silicates adorn interior walls of both the villages and cities, featuring themes that conjure feelings of speed and motion, sometimes including native fauna such as the skizzard. \n\n[P]As a species, the Xexto have grown used to a lifestyle of risk-taking, and bravery in the face of a challenge is their most valued quality. Political campaigns for leadership often boil down to a series of escalating dares, where the first to back down or die loses. Some Xexto, such as those starring in the Cresh Krill Yirt series of holovids, have developed cult-like followings for their daring stunts, which often result in predictably awful injuries. \n\n[P]While the Xexto have many pursuits, including mosaic art, traditional drum music, and teasing local predators, their cultural obsession is Podracing. Their world has a number of tracks that run through the dense forests and mountains of Troiken, and some cross over to the uninhabitable portions of the planet. Gasgano has long been a racing legend on Troiken, and many young Xexto idolize him and purchase merchandise related to the aging racer to this day. Xexto off Troiken are often competing in or following a racing circuit, usually that of Podracing, though anything fast is appealing to them. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Troiken is a tidally locked planet in the Colunda sector's Troiken system near the Rimward edge of the Perlemian Trade Route, which causes the inner half of the planet to burn under the heat of its star and the outer half to freeze. A large moon in a polar orbit traces a narrow ring of habitable land to provide something approaching a day-night cycle. \n\n[P]The mountains are large, purple-hued rocks with labyrinthine mines tunneled over thousands of years. The Hormick Range once harbored large deposits of andris and collafa spice, though most believe those mines are dry. Hormick Ranges Mount Avos was the historical site of the decisive battle of the Stark Hyperspace War, a conflict that preceded the Clone Wars. The mountains are home to the carnivorous challat eaters, fist-sized bioluminescent insects that flew in massive swarms, devouring everything in their path. The mountains also feature predatory, cat-like leaptigs, which stalk the nearby valleys and plains in packs for grazers and bantha offshoots. \n\n[P]The forests of Troiken house two-thirds of the world's Xexto. Historically, the Xexto's earliest cities were primitive tree houses connected by cables near mountains. Early Xexto had to contend with dozens of forest predators, and while most predators still exist on Troiken today, they are predominantly in zoological exhibits and preserves. Of course, this only rarely stops Xexto from hopping a fence to slap a horn-faced surtops in the flank. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Xexto have developed the Xextese language, which consists of rapid nasal jabbering. Xextese also has a written component, but few non-Xexto bother to learn to speak or read Xextese. Most Xexto have learned to speak at least a broken version of Basic or Huttese, which sounds like a reedy and nasal jabbering in their long throats.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Additional Limbs : Xexto have four arms and gain an additional free maneuver per turn.  They still may not perform more than two maneuvers per turn, however.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"XEXTO"}},"_id":"P5zUXKoMCxtcOqdd"}
{"name":"Clawdite","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/CLAWDITE.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Clawdite[h4]\nNative to the planet Zolan in the Mid Rim, Clawdites are primarily known across the rest of the galaxy for their innate ability to transform their appearance. This knack grants the species a value to the larger galaxy that far exceeds any of their homeworld's other exports—to the chagrin of many Clawdites, some of whom feel that their species' cultural and technological contributions to galactic culture are ignored because of the fixation on their very peculiar genetic ability. Because of their shape-changing talents, Clawdites remain in high demand for careers focused upon deception, including espionage and other, even less savory pursuits. Their natural abilities and scarcity give members of the species legendary status as spies and informants. Rumors of Clawdite's presence naturally alert guilty parties to be more vigilant, while a crime lord who retains a Clawdite's services gains prestige through the hire.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Clawdites are humanoid species with reptilian traits. In their default forms, their skin has a rough texture that typically ranges in color from pale yellow to dark green. The pupils of their large eyes are slitted, with irises that range in color from yellow to deep blue. However, many galactic citizens who interact with Clawdites never actually see this form, or even know that they are dealing with a Clawdite. Some Clawdites create a single preferred guise that they use for their public dealings, never showing their true form. This has various advantages, from throwing potential enemies off guard when they reveal themselves to keeping suspicion that they might be an infiltrator to a minimum. After all, when people know there is a Clawdite around, they tend to be more cautious. On the other hand, some Clawdites use this to their advantage by openly displaying their true forms to remind everyone of their unique ability—especially when that ability is an asset tot he job at hand. Those Clawdites who do not rely upon their shapeshifting for professional reasons tend to remain in their default state around others to help reassure them that they are acting in good faith. These practices vary by individual and the expectations of the company that they currently keep.\n[P]Clawdites have two inherent physiological traits that enable their shape-changing. The first is the particularly sophisticated chromatophores that exist within their skin cells. These enable them to change their skin tone at will, and Clawdites with sufficient practice  can match nearly any color that their eyes can perceive. The second is the capacity to control aspects of their lymphatic system consciously and with great precision. Using this control, a trained Clawdite can physically shrink and grow parts of their body, stretching their skin to take on different shapes. Replicating a specific appearance in this way requires practice.\n[P]Because Clawdites depend upon their body's internal abilities to shape-change, they cannot alter their mass in the process. This means that they can make minor alterations to their size based on their density but they cannot substantially grow or shrink. Their humanoid anatomy also prevents them from relocating organs, except in superficial ways. To help offset this limitation, some Clawdites wear an automated saline pump. This enables them to adjust the amount of fluid withing their bodies, increasing their ability to change their size within a limited range.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Clawdites have a particularly strong inclination toward individualism, and many have a difficult time forming close bonds, even—or especially—with members of their own species. This is in part because of the mutability of their appearance. A trusted contact could vanish with a shared resource, or a deceitful individual could easily assume another's identity. As a consequence, their society on Zolan has developed various measures to verify identities. Political and social organizations depend upon high levels of redundancy, and records are maintained in the open os that individuals can freely validate on another's work. Nevertheless, personal responsibility and accountability have remained challenging principles to enforce across Clawdite history. Most Clawdltes are\nguarded even when greeting familiar individuals, and\nrely on conversational cues and personality traits far \nmore than physical appearance to verify identity.\n[P]Clawdites’ entrance onto the galactic stage an large\nhad a substantial impact on their culture and how\nthey viewed their ability. Their unique shapeshifting\ntrait made Clawdites the perfect spies, and many\nwere hired to work offworld by governments, criminal syndicates, and military organizations. Now, Ciawdites are found all across the Outer Rim—though some\nClawdites live in secret, preferring that their acquaintances not know their true species, lest they didtrust\nthem for it or worse, try to exploit it.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Zolan is a warm and arid world, located\nnear the Corellian Run. During the development of the Clawdite species, a spike in solar activity bathed the world in radiation. The Clawdite’s ability to modify their skin color and body shape was one of many adaptations that resulted from this massive change in Zolan’s Climate. The predatory monzu and numerous other species from Zolan share this traiL, though many species developed different means of surviving despite the ongoing radiation bombardment. As with any event that disrupts a period of evolutiononary stasis, most of Zolan’s lifeforms were unable to cope with the heightened radiation and died off precipitously, and those that remained dramatically shaped by it.\n[P]Zolan’s radiation levels eventually reverted to a more survivable level, as its star completed its extreme radiation emission cycle. Traits developed to survive this catastrophe were turned to new ends, resulting in a number of species that could change their physiology as well as others with thick bony plating to protect against radiation. Beyond that, the extinction event reshaped\nZolan. Large portions of the planet became desolate wastelands. Most of the plants and animals that had once dwelt there were eliminated, and new life forms only slowly encroached on the most devastated regions.\n[P]This planetary transformation had serious repercussions on the world's environment, as well as its ability to provide for the Ciawdite population. In fact, the resultant scarcity of resources very likely contributed to the cautious and self-rellanl nature of Clawdite society as it developed.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Virtually all Clawdites are fluent in Basic. Zolanese is their native tongue, though it is rarely hear off the planet. Clawdites generally refuse to teach Zolanese to offworlders, and it is used as a primary language only in the rural regions of their world. During rare offworld encounters between Clawdites, they often use Zolanese as a secret language to identify themselves without breaking their cover.\n[P][B]Life on the Fringe:[b] Clawdites excel in careers that\nprioritize independent competency. Though many rely upon more nefarious (or at least self-serving) applications of their shapeshffting abilities to work as Smugglers or Bounty Hunters, many other Clawdites work as Explorers, Technicians, or in specialized Colonist roles. Many Clawdites who originally hail from Zolan prefer self-reliant professions over which they have a high degree of control, rather than having to trust that others will act in their best interests.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Change Form : At the cost of 2 Strain, a\n            Clawdite can choose to upgrade their Deception\n            check to convey a false appearance which lasts\n            until the Clawdite wills the change to end, or\n            until they are knocked unconscious or killed.

The Elomin are tall and exclusively bipedal, with physical traits similar to those of\nother humanoid species in the galaxy. The Eloms are\nshorter, stockier, and covered in fur, and have a large\nhead with widespread eyes. The Elomin were known\nfirst to the rest of the galaxy, after Republic scouts first\nmade contact with the world. In fact, the surface dwelling Elomin were themselves ignorant of the Eloms'\nexistence until the former pursued extensive mining efforts and inadvertently crashed into the Eloms'\nunderground territories. The Elomin were not keen to\nshare their cold, dry world, but eventually yielded to\nRepublic pressure. The two species pursue a separate\nexistence from each other whenever possible.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Elomin are tall humanoids with thin heads crowned by four distinctive horns. Away from their homeworld, they are occasionally mistaken for Zabraks, who are more common across the galaxy.\nThe Elomin have large, pointed ears and nearly solidcolored, bright eyes of a wide variety of hues. Their skin\ncolor ranges from black to brighter shades of red. Their\nfingers have small sharp, claw-like nails.\n[P]Despite long involvement in the Republic and the\nEmpire, many Elomin prefer working on their own or\nwith other Elomin whenever possible. These xenophobic tendencies also play into their dealings with the\nEloms. However, in spite of their insular societal tendencies, many individual Elomin are driven by a thirst\nfor knowledge that takes them into the wider galaxy.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Elomin live in politically divided\nlands, with countries and cities. They actively participated in galactic society and were members of the\nRepublic long before their discovery of the Elom. Joining the former Republic advanced Elomin technology\nto a very advanced space age in a short time. The Elomin pursue patterns of logic and puzzle out the ways\nof the universe. They are capable of reordering their\nthinking when presented with enough evidence, but\nthey can stubbornly hold to previous ideas and ignore\nnew discoveries or advances until it is overwhelming.\nThis dogged adherence to a well-established order\ncemented the Elomin stance after the initial discovery of the Eloms. The decree recognizing the Eloms’\nsentience forced the Elomin to formally acknowledge\nthe reality. It has taken years of Imperial abuse for\nthe Elomin to acknowledge that they now must turn\nto their underground neighbors for assistance so that\nboth species can survive.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Elom is a frigidly cold desert world.\nElomin settlements and cities dot the surface. Their\ncities are as technologically advanced as those found\non most Imperial worlds. The planet is best known\nas a source of lommite, which is used in the manufacture of transparisteel windows for starships and\nother craft. Originally an industry contracted out to\noffworld mining operators, it is now controlled by the\nEmpire. Whereas the original agreements tried to\npreserve and respect the planet’s environment, the\nImperials place efficiency and production well above\nlocal concerns. The steady, continued destruction\nof vast areas of their world trouble and anger both\nthe Elomin and Eloms. Both have been powerless to\nslow it down, let alone bring it to a halt.\n[P]Elomin cities and towns are clustered in the more\nhospitable environments around the harsher deserts. Mining operations are farther afield, given that\nmines close to the oldest cities were depleted long\nago. Imperial interests and operations focus on the\nmines. Imperials in the cities have no qualms about\nforcing Elomin into service as miners. Banishment\nto the mines is a common and cruel form of punishment for anyone who opposes the Empire or offends\nthe wrong Imperial official. However, reasons for\nhauling someone away are just a formality, and the\nElomin understand that anyone could be next.\n[P]The Empire has largely ignored the Eloms’ deep\ncities, located far below the planet’s surface. The\ncities have varying levels of technology, depending\non the location and even the neighborhood within a\nsettlement. Most advanced technology is imported\nfrom the Elomin and sometimes beyond. Many cities, remote caverns, and dwellings are connected\nby natural and Elom-constructed tunnels. The tunnels range in size from those requiring single file passage, to more sophisticated varieties with paved floors and reinforced roofs. Some are large enough to allow for speeder traffic. Many of the cities and tunnels are so far underground that the Imperials have difficulty detecting them, let alone setting up surveillance. The cities are largely home to just the Eloms. However, some Elomin reused from Imperial mining efforts have been allowed to live among the Eloms indefinitely.\n[P][B]Language (Elomin):[b] The Elomin speak a language\nmuch closer to Basic than the Eloms, and most Elomin struggle to learn the language of their neighbors The few Elomin who make the effort to learn\nElom are usually those who end up living with the\nEloms after rescue from the mines or seek out Elom\nenclaves to learn more about them.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 18 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Education":{"mod":"Education","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"ELOMIN"}},"_id":"QFOxNYuGYnBfvDvl"}
{"name":"Herglic","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/HERGLIC.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Herglic[h4]\n\nThe Herglics, alternatively known as Koodans, are a race native to the planet Giju. They are water-based mammals, and developed hyperdrive and a trade based empire in the Colonies Region before encountering the Duros. Herglics are pleasant and peaceful, but they have an addiction to gambling and games of chance. Herglics are a very large species and are sensitive about their size.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Herglics are large bipeds that appear to have evolved from water-dwelling mammals. Most of the evidence of their water borne ancestry has been bred out so that, for example, fins and flukes have been replaced with arms and legs. They do, however, still breathe through a blowhole on the top of their heads. The hauum sound of a Herglic clearing their blowhole is a common Herglese word throughout the Tapani sector where it is used with emphasis to preface a significant remark.\n\n[P]They are tall, extremely wide, and have smooth, hairless skin that ranged in color from pale blue to black although some have pale pink skin. A few Herglics display white stripes down the sides of their head and arms.\n\n[P]Herglics are generally quite sensitive about their large size. Since most other sentient species in the galaxy are smaller than they are and most facilities are designed to accommodate Human dimensions, Herglics tend to feel somewhat self-conscious and out of place when removed from their community or their ships. Their bulky size means that typically a Herglic will take up two seats in a restaurant and the majority of doorways require some maneuvering. Despite this they are typically easygoing in nature and enjoy meeting new people and visiting exotic locations.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Herglics of Giju were a technologically advanced race early in galactic history, reaching the stars of neighboring systems and began colonization in about the same time period as the Corellians reached theirs. There is some archaeological evidence that an early Herglic trading Empire achieved a superior level of technology that was not paralleled during the Rebellion era.\n\n[P]Ruins are found on some Herglic colony worlds that contained non-functioning machines that appeared to harness gravity to perform an unfathomed function. This early Empire, however, collapsed a millennium before the Herglics made contact with the wider galaxy and most records were lost.\n\n[P]The Herglics are natural explorers and traders. During the early days of the Galactic Republic the angular freighters characteristic of Herglic trading vessels became a common sight throughout the galaxy but contact with the Republic remained minimal. They have an inquisitive but practical nature and calm persona that help them interact with other species and make them a welcome member of the Galactic community.\n\n[P]With the rise of the Galactic Empire Giju's manufacturing centers were among the first to be nationalized by the Emperor's New Order. The normally docile Herglics tried to fight the subjugators but after significant slaughter and realizing that their resistance was in vain they decided to be pragmatic and submit totally to the will of the Emperor. Fortunately they stopped resisting and surrendered before the destruction of Giju's infrastructure. During the Galactic Civil War period a number of Herglics purchased their way into the Tapani nobility when House Cadriaan began selling titles to nonhumans.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Giju is the Herglic homeworld. Located in the Colonies, it is on the Rimma Trade Route and is one endpoint of the Giju Run. Giju is an aquatic-type world with large bodies of water and associated terrain including: expansive oceans, islands, marshes, and glaciers. Giju has many spaceports and manufacturing centers.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Herglese or Herglic is the language of the Herglics from the planet Giju. Most Herglics also learn to speak Basic, so Herglese is not quite extended.\n\n[P]Due to the influence of Herglic trading within the Tapani sector several Herglic words have been incorporated into the local vocabulary.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":14,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"HERGLIC"}},"_id":"QZYoiypJBjKJEH2d"}

Instead, most prefer to live in cooperation with their planet’s natural ecosystems. In fact, Gungan galactic travelers are often exiles. Gungan law is unforgiving, and expulsion is a common form of punishment. Consequently, Gungans found offworld are seldom characteristic of the species.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Gungans are a bipedal, amphibious species. They are tall and thin, averaging nearly two meters in height. Their expressive, long ears and eyestalks are set around a bill-like mouth. They are omnivorous, with a diet composed largely of mollusks and aquatic plants. Gungan compound lungs are capable of efficiently extracting oxygen from both air and water. Gungan infants are born as tadpoles within water cradles. Their limbs develop within a month of birth.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The various Gungan cities are largely stratified according to residents’ membership in particular clans. Interrelations between cities have been established through carefully worded treaties. A High Council serves as an overall governing body that exists largely to resolve disputes between the different cities.\n[P]Gungan society places a very high value on peace and order. While they are a generally happy people, they have little tolerance for elements that disrupt their lives. Even minor crimes are treated severely; Vandalism, for example, merits corporal punishment or even exile.\n[P]Gungans are proud of their independence and are willing to go to great lengths to defend it. Each city maintains its own militia armed with energy shields and plas- mic energy balls. Gungans make extensive use of animal mounts, and their natural tools remain effective in combination with their shield technologies. The various militias train together regularly and can assemble into a planetary Grand Army to face broader threats.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Gungans are native to the planet Naboo near the Outer Rim Territories, though they share habitation with humans on that world. The planet’s climate is primarily temperate. Substantial oceans separate its heavily forested landmasses. Almost all Gungan habitats are largely underwater,\nwhile cities dominated by humans are located upon dry land. The two species have a long history of interacting peacefully with one another. The Gungan High Council links Gungan and human societies together to form a planetary government. Members of both species contribute to the democratic process, particularly for interaction with offworld entities. Currently, this government is under the oversight of the Empire.\n[P]Naboo’s oceans have a broad range of predators, including the sando aqua monster and the opee, both large enough to swallow a bongo sub in a single bite. Areas immediately surrounding their cities are largely secure, but extended journeys can incorporate a high degree of risk.\n[P][B]Languages:[b] All Gungans speak their native Gungan as well as Basic.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Gungans do not have a native Force tradition or a strong tradition of membership in the Jedi Order. However, their cultural tendencies to live in connection with the natural world are consistent with an understanding of the Living Force. Gungan underwater cities are relatively isolated, even from Naboo’s human population. It is likely that Jedi simply failed to discover the majority of Gungan Force sensitives who might have joined the order.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Hold Breath : Gungans can hold their breath for\n          a number ofrounds equal to 10 times their Brawn\n        rating before they risk drowning.</p><p>Natural Swimmers : Gungans never suffer penalties to movement while traveling through water.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Coordination":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GUNGAN"}},"_id":"QzXqQyDpDxkkwqeU"}

They excel at problem solving and strategic thinking, and their compatibility with both humans and non-humans make them excellent bridges between disparate cultures. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Near-humans with dark-blue skin and glowing red eyes, the Chiss tend to run to the tall side of the human body type. Their skin color and eyes grow more intense the greater concentration of oxygen they are in. On average, Chiss tend to be more physically fit and overall more attractive than regular humans, assuming one is not thrown off by the skin and eyes. Their hair is universally jet black, save for the silvering found in those of advanced age. \n\n[P]Genetic analysis reveals that the Chiss are an offshoot of humanity, most likely dating back to the earliest eras of expansionism. Millennia of subterranean living altered their biology considerably. Not only did it result in the shift of their appearance from standard human but also their greater strength, endurance, and other physical qualities over baseline humans. They also reach physical maturity much more rapidly; most are physically and emotionally mature by their early teens, and on average, Chiss live about 80 standard years. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Cautious, thoughtful, and highly cultured, the Chiss have generally kept to themselves as a civilization for much of their long history. Rare individuals venture forth from the Chiss Ascendancy, as most prefer to keep to the security of a society they revere as superior. Art, culture, intellectual advancement, and discipline are highly prized qualities among the Chiss, and they have worked hard to build a society that relies not upon economic achievement but upon personal growth and contributions to the society as a whole. \n\n[P]Those Chiss that do venture into the galaxy at large do so generally with a profound respect for their peoples' desire to remain apart from the Empire and its struggles. Few beings outside of the Chiss even know where the Ascendancy is, which is the preferred state of affairs for them. Individual Chiss see the chance for great personal growth among the stars, as well as a chance to learn many things they can take back to their people. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Though most Chiss believe their world was a kind of tropical paradise when their ancestors first landed on it, the planet of Csilla entered a full-bore ice age nearly 5,000 years ago. Glaciers ultimately claimed the surface of the world, driving the technologically advanced people below ground. There, in thousands of warrens built to manage resources and energy effectively, with extensive networks of passages to keep the civilization connected and unified, the Chiss have thrived as a species. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Though any Explorer Chiss will know Basic, he's also fluent in a language only a member of his species can speak properly—Cheunh. Though Chiss are biologically connected to and similar to humans in most ways, they possess certain variances in their vocal apparatus that permit sounds and textures to their speech that make for a language many other species find strangely beautiful to hear. The structure of the language, steeped in context-derived combinations of words for idea expression, as well as the unique nature of Chiss vocal abilities, necessitated their adoption of trade languages. Sy Bisti and Minnisiat served the species well after they first reached outward from their homeworld, Csilla.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Infravision : Chiss have adapted to be able to see in both the infrared and normal visual spectra.\n          This enables Chiss characters to remove up to [SETBACK] added to checks by lighting conditions.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Cool":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"CHISS"}},"_id":"R1Cdrb9cQts3GCPn"}
{"name":"Gand","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/GAND.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Gand[h4]\nGands are a mysterious insectoid species whose \"findsmen\" treat tracking quarry as a religious duty. They are exceptionally good at divining the location of individuals through ritualistic methods that off-worlders might consider backward and barbaric.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Though prevalent in the fringes of the Outer Rim, Gands remain a puzzle to xenobiologists. Over a dozen distinct subspecies of the Gands have been reported. All are covered in a dense chitinous exoskeleton and reach a height at adulthood of about 1.6 meters. They have three fingers on each hand, which are as dexterous as those of other humanoids, allowing them to manipulate equipment designed for five-fingered individuals.\n\n[P]Where Gands subspecies differ from one another is in their respiratory biology. Most Gands who travel the spacelanes do not seem to need to breathe at all. The digestion of food in their stomachs produces the ammo-nia necessary for their biochemistry. Wasteful byproducts and extraneous ammonia are expelled through their exo-skeletons. These Gands often emanate an unpleasant methane musk. Other Gand subspecies possess actual lungs and cannot produce ammonia through digestion, instead requiring a special breathing apparatus.\n\n[P]Questions about Gand biology continue to go unanswered, since the Gand refuse to permit other species to study them. Some xenobiologists conjecture that Gand religious rituals dictate genetic manipulation, which has produced many different varieties of Gands.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Gands have a closed culture. What is known about them is that religion and life are closely entwined. A gathering of elders called the Ruetsavii observes the various religious sects that represent the virtues of Gand life. Off-worlders are most familiar with the religious sect known as the \"findsmen.\" These are the Gand who leave their home planet on ritualistic hunts to catch prey and bring divine blessings to their people. Many other sects are rumored to exist, particularly in the fields of genetics, medicine, and engineering, but their exact natures are unknown.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Sharing the same name as its species, Gand is an Outer Rim world clouded in ammonia and methane. Trade is handled through orbiting stations as foreigners are rarely allowed on the planet's surface. Those non-Gand who land on the world must stay in the specially equipped Alien Quarters.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Droids fare much better than well-trained humanoid linguists in reproducing the clicks and chirrups of the Gand spoken language. Without the need to intake breathable gases, most Gand lack the vocal cords to make the sounds of Basic and other languages. They must use droids or translation devices to converse in groups that do not understand their language.\n\n[P]The grammar that Gand use reflects their place in society. Before a Gand earns his identity and is accepted among his peers, he refers to himself in the third person, calling himself \"Gand.\" Once he has done a deed of distinction, a Gand may take his family name. Gand cannot use their first names until they have become \"persons of greatness\"—janwuine in their own tongue—and received commendations from their peers. This causes many off-worlders to view the Gand as a people of extreme humility.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Has Lungs : Requires ammonia respirator</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Edge of the Empire Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Discipline":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GAND"}},"_id":"RbrYo4MWdF5oUJsn"}
{"name":"Quermian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/QUERMIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Quermian[h4]\n\n  The Quermian species is an offshoot of the Xexto, produced through genetic tampering long ago by Arkanian scientists. Though larger than their Xexto cousins, Quermians tend to be less physically adept; they rarely make full use of their great height or the extended reach of their four arms. Most rely instead on the extensive mental processing power offered by their dual brains which they use to read other species for their own benefit/\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Quermians are a tall, spindly species with slender torsos surrounded by six limbs—including two pairs of arms—and extended necks nearly as lengthy as the trunks from which they  rise. Their skin tends toward a pale, ashen hue and is frequently wrinkled with slight folds. Their faces have only smooth skin where the nose is found on many other species, instead, olfactory organs on their hands perform the function of detecting scents.\n[P]Like the Xexto, Quermians have two brains, one in their head and one in their chest. Unlike their cousins, who divide different functions between the two brains, Quermians each have two fully developed brain. In some Quermians each of the two brains even develops its own separate personality. In Quermians  who are controlled by a unified minds, the secondary brain operates in tandem with the first, processing input with a level of detail and insight that can seem uncanny to many other species. In particular, the dual brains of the Quermians allow them to read otherwise undetectable signals in the body language of any species. Quermians sometimes expose this understanding to communicate silently through minute shifts in posture, allying them to act in concert without any words being exchanged. The level of insight and communication Quermians are known to display has given them a strange reputation among other species who sometimes suspect them of possessing further gifts of even an innate force sensitivity.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Quermian society is largely focused inward, with a simple, communal lifestyle allows that individuals to concentrate on their own needs. By the standards of most advanced societies, the Quermians consume very little. Many members of the species spend much of their time on intangible pursuits such as philosophy or the production of art, literature and music. The nature of Quermian intuition and communication is such that members of their society who want for basic necessities are easy to identify, and swift aid is typically rendered to these individuals. Even the most selfish Quermians can rarely stomach reading the pain of these fellows for long.\n[P]When in the company of sentients outside their species, Quermians often operate very differently. Their ability to read other species is not as sharp as their understanding of each other. However, it does offer them an edge in most social maneuvering, giving them something of a reputation as manipulators or hucksters. Certainly, some Quermians revel in their ability to so easily discern hidden motives and desires, although many simply use the talents to avoid being manipulated themselves.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The ancestors of  modern Quermians were named for Quermia, the world on which the Arkanians settled them. After the ancient Arkanians moved on, the Quermians developed their own society, centered on a largely peaceful communal lifestyle and the contemplation of philosophy. The long peace of Quermian society can at least partially be attributed to the ease with which the species is able to communicate and share its feelings and concerns.\n[P]Of course, Quermia's history is not entirely peaceful, although strife usually has come from outside influence, rather than internal struggles. During the Clone Wars, Quermia was isolated from the Republic in Seperatist space, and it suffered heavily under an extensive blockade. With the fall of the Seperatist cause, the blockade was lifted, but Imperial rule is not usually considered a substantial improvement among the generally peaceful Quermians. Given the Empire's propaganda campaign against the Jedi and its purges of Force users, some Quermians even fear that their frequently misunderstood talents might lead the Empire to take drastic measures against them.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Quermian language, which goes by the same name as the species, is known mostly for its melodious sound. However, it is also a language with a great deal of specialized vocabulary, developed over the species' long history of philosophical introspection. Although most Quermians also speak fluent Basic, they take great pride in their own language, enjoying it for its sound as well as for the ease with which it can express complex abstract concepts.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Additional Limbs : Quermians have four arms and gain an additional free maneuver per turn.

{"name":"Tognaths","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/TOGNATHS.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Tognaths[h4]\nHailing from the planet Yar Togna, the mysterious Tognaths are tall, quiet humanoid adorned with cybernetic enhancements and life-support equipment. Renowned for their commitment to confidentiality and their quiet nature, Tognaths, some joke, could rival the infamous Bothans as information brokers, if only they'd share their secrets with each other.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Tognaths are a curious insecto-mammalian species with smooth, fleshy skin and beady, lidless compound eyes. They stand just under two meters on average. Evolutionarily ancient, with robust but underdeveloped nervous systems, they often use cybernetic enhancements to augment their otherwise sub-par hearing and balance. Many wear special lenses to aid in vision as well. Such augmentations might appear painful, but their primitive nervous systems mean they are immune to such annoyances. Tognath share many genetic ties with the Kel Dors and Gands, but whether this genetic relationship is the result of evolution or experimentation is unknown.\n[P]Tognaths begin life as larvae born from egg clutches hatched in a suspension jelly, and latch onto one of their parents, feeding directly from their bloodstream. Six months later, parents visit a nursery tree, where the young detach from them and spin a cocoon. Within, the offspring undergo a metamorphosis, developing both and endoskeleton and an exoskeleton to resist the high gravity and atmospheric pressure of Yar Togna. This metamorphosis, together with their primitive innate nervous system, dulls most of their pain receptors, causing adult Tognaths to feel little, if any, pain. Several months after spinning its cocoon, a child-sized Tognath emerges.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Tognath live in stilted homes with lava channels near the mean mountain range of Yar Togna, where they have access to mountain springwater. Most of Tognath society believes that mate selection and egg laying should occur late in life, after having dedicated most of one's prime years to a career. This means that parents are generally retired and dote on their children relentlessly, often homeschooling them after their transformation.\n[P]Most Tognath work as crystal miners of magma skimmers, though others farm the more rural flatlands. However, the most romanticized Tognath career is that of a float farmer. Float farmers raise delicacies directly on the backs of float-jellies, massive floating gasbags that eat ash from erupting volcanoes. The secretions on the float-jelly's back makes for a rich soil capable of growing mushrooms, mosses, and molds prized throughout the galaxy. Float farming is very dangerous, whether a Tognath farmer is a pilot braving volcanic updrafts and float-jelly collisions or a leaper harvesting produce from the back of a float-jelly. The most successful float farmers are egg mates, able to sense each other's location and judge their safety at all times.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Yar Togna is a foul-smelling, high-gravity world with a toxic, fume-saturated atmosphere. Continental subduction created a gargantuan volcanic mountain range that has pumped ash and sulfur into the air for millions of years. The planet's dense atmosphere causes particulates to remain airborne, which would have plunged the world into a deep freeze long ago if not for lumbering herds of massive, ash-eating float-jellies.\n[P]Intense fault-line pressure on Yar Togna creates unique crystalline elements vital to sensor-array manufacturing. Tognath once mined and sold crystals to corporations like Fabritech and Idellian Arrays, but Count Denetrius Vidian convinced the Empire that nationalization would increase output. The Empire took over Yar Togna and enslaved the populace. Even Tognath who have escaped still feel imprisoned, as they are kept far from the nurseries essential to perpetuating their civilization. Like all Tognath away from Yar Togna, they also require pressure suits and respirators to replicate the atmospheric conditions of their homeworld.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Tognath vocal chords evolved for an unusually dense, sulfur-rich atmosphere and, as such, their deep voices are too faint for most species to hear without technological aid. Tognath seldom speak; and when they do, their respirator amplifiers often garble their words.\n[P][B]Life under the Empire:[b] Tognath who escape Yar Togna are often skilled pilots. Many find work as couriers for secret or sensitive goods and information, as their ability to ignore pain makes them ideal for resisting torture. This has given them a reputation for keeping secrets, which has helped other Tognath find work as advisors and corporate or military analysts. It has also, unfortunately, led some beings to find them untrustworthy, as in some circles such resilience means it is impossible to determine whether a subject is telling the truth. No matter what they do, almost all Tognath bear a grudge against the Empire over the treatment of their people and the co-opting of their planet. Most find their way to anti-Imperial extremist groups or the nascent rebellion.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Primitive Nerves : Add [SE][SE] to Coercion checks targeting Tognath characters.</p><p>Atmospheric Requirement : Tognaths must wear a specialized mask or breathing apparatus to breathe outside their native atmosphere.

{"name":"Kaminoan","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/KAMINOAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Kaminoan[h4]\nThe secretive and isolationist Kaminoans saw the end of an ice age flood their planet, and their scientists turned to genetic manipulation to survive. Society changed rapidly as bioengineering became an integral part of their life. Not content with simply altering the genetics of native flora and fauna to prevent a mass extinction, the Kaminoans began to alter themselves.\n[P]Kaminoans isolated genes for intelligence, strength, speed, grace, abstract thinking, linear thinking, sensory perception, and in some cases, aesthetics. They also developed a caste-like society based on genetic selection. Determining the caste focus of the next generation combined a complex mixture of societal pressure, personal preferences, economic considerations, and other current concerns.\n[P]This concentration on genetic manipulation pulled their society further away from galactic interaction. Eventually, however, the Kaminoans saw a market for one of their skills: cloning. Their work attracted the attention of the Republic, and the Kaminoans turned all their efforts toward creating its Grand Army.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Taller on average than humans, Kaminoans tend to be slender, with an elongated neck and oblong head. Descended from an aquatic species, they retain the flowing, graceful movements of their ancestors as well as the ability to see into the ultra-violet spectrum with their large eyes. Although Kaminoans seem to favor white as a design aesthetic, they are able to discern a vast range of patterns and colors that appear simply as white to other species.\n[P]Unlike most species, Kaminoans utilize their knowledge of genetic engineering on themselves. Whether their current physical presentation is as much a product of that engineering as it is \"natural\" is a matter of some debate. Kaminoans enjoy an extended but healthy old age without the usual physical debility or mental degradation. Gender is considered an aesthetic choice, the only difference being that male Kaminoans sport a headcrest, while female Kaminoans do not.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Kaminoans generally maintain an air of polite impassiveness. As a result, outsiders consider them emotionless and identical. It doesn't help that Kaminoans choose similar clothing, although many important individuals wear a large, pale collar around their neck. In reality, Kaminoans express a more relaxed emotional attitude with each other.\n[P]As a genetically and socially engineered society, the Kaminoans remain isolationist and culturally naive. Their caste structure assigns each Kaminoan to a specific duty based on genetic and intellectual predisposition. Outliers do exist, and though they are not shunned, they tend to become curiosities as others try to determine how the deviation occurred.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The thawing at the end of its last ice age dramatically changed Kamino. The world, now covered in a global ocean, suffers from constant storms and massive winds. Cities provide shelter from the wind, rain, and water, rising high above the ocean surface on stilted anchors. The cities harness electricity from the storms, while the warm ocean provides plenty of rich nutrients and biodiversity. Kaminoan trade in genetic samples means that several offworld creatures, such as the aiwha, now also live there.\n[P]Of particular note is that many stellar databases don't contain Kamino's location, beyond the Outer Rim near the Rishi Maze. When they developed the cloning program for the Republic, the Kaminoans asked to have the location of their planet redacted to protect their privacy. Since the Clone Wars ended, that information has trickled back sporadically.\n[P][B]Language:[b] While Kaminoans speak their native language, those who choose to deal with outsiders learn Basic. Conversely, very few outsiders speak Kaminoan, and those who do are reluctant to teach others. Kaminoans guard their written language carefully, relying on written Basic in their communications with other species.\n[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b] Kaminoans have a difficult relationship with the Rebel Alliance. Their species not only developed and supplied the clone army for the Republic, but also joined the Galactic Senate to fight against the Separatists. Some have joined the Alliance as engineers, biogeneticists, and physicians.

{"name":"Mustafarian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/MUSTAFARIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Mustafarian[h4]\nThe perpetually volcanic, burning world of Mustafar seems an unlikely place for anything to thrive, let alone a sentient species. Mustafar once teemed with life, like so many terrestrial worlds, until the planet's orbit changed dramatically. Ancient legends claim a mythical, ruinous weapon shifted the orbit of the nearby gas giant Lefrani. This epic cataclysm sent Mustafar into an unusual and gravitationally crushing alignment between Lefrani and another nearby gas giant, Jestelad. Very few species survived the resulting volcanic cataclysm. Force to areas in the north and near the equatorial regions of the world, the remaining Mustafarians adapted and evolved to their new realities. The northern Mustafarians became tall and thin, while those near the equator became shorter, but stronger and stouter. Of course, these ancient tales can hardly be confirmed with any certainty; what is clear is that Mustafar is an extreme environment, and the species that shares its name with the world has adapted to its harsh climes.\n[P]The Mustafarians themselves aren't overly aggressive, so instead of allowing pointless tribalism to rule the tw\no groups usually work together to harvest their world's meager resources. Development picked up as off-worlders took a greater interest in the world's particular commodities. The Mustafarians greatly benefited from the introduction of higher technology. Mustafarians seem to have a natural affinity for technology, and they strive to advance it to help them survive more easily. No matter how durable imported technology seems to be, Mustafarians have learned from tragic experience  never to really trust it until they have a chance to modify and further harden it against the blast furnace that is their harsh environment.\n[P]Though infighting between Mustafarian groups is uncommon, highly aggressive creatures are a great hazard on the world, thanks to competition over scarce resources. As they and most of Mustafar's native creatures are highly resistant to heat, the Mustafarians sentries and combatants regularly wield their specialized gear, whether working the mines or patrolling on their massive lava fleas. Even Mustafarian melee weapons are heavier and more durable compared to their off-world counterparts.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The two kinds of Mustafarians are genetically similar, but have developed differently over the innumerable generations since the ancient cataclysm. The taller norther Mustafarians are more vulnerable to damage. Thus, stouter southern Mustafarians more often take on the harsher work, such as laboring in the Mining Guild's lava extraction operations.\n[P]Mustafarians are arthropods, with  a tough exoskeleton over leathery skin. They are bipedal and somewhat humanoid. They have long snouts and large eyes on either side of their heads. Even unprotected, Mustafarians can naturally withstand far more heat than most species. Though many of their adaptations came about to help them survive the heat, Mustafarians still wear armor and heavy environmental protection gear when outside of their underground shelters. They have a limited capability to survive on the surface without survival gear, but rarely put this durability to the test.\n[P]Workers and travelers who spend extended amounts of time outside typically wear breath masks to further protect themselves from the noxious fumes that can sometimes flood the surface due to the sudden eruptions or shifts in the blasting wind. A significant percentage of the population opts to install cybernetics to aid in certain tasks and improve their likelihood of survival. Such enhancements are helpful but not usually extravagant. They tend to complement the Mustafarians' natural abilities, rather than replace them wholesale. However, severely injured Mustafarians who require replacement limbs or organs often have no qualms about gaining an advantage from their otherwise unfortunate situation. They are only limited by what they can afford, which can be a significant hindrance.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Living on a world that demands so much effort just to stay alive has made the Mustafarians insular and disinterested in galactic affairs. Their focus on advancement and survival of their species overrides other concerns, and many regard off-worlders with little curiosity. They are politically organized in accordance with the caverns and communities they inhabit. While the two subspecies live together as needed, the geographical distance and limited desirable living space tends to keep them in their own communities. There is little in the way of central government, but some of the more trusted leaders are allowed to cut deals with off-worlders. THese deals almost always help ensure Mustafarian survival and quality of life.\n[P]Such thinking led them to fall under the sway of the Techno Union before and during the Clone Wars. After the Seperatist defeat and the rise of the Empire, the Mining Guild took over much of the heavy industry and lava skimming that the Techno Union had started. So long as it helps their cause, Mustafarians are generally willing to tolerate a degree of outside political interference.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Mustafar is a hot, volcanic planet with constant eruptions and massive rivers of lava that cut across the landscape. The Mustafarians find relief and shelter in natural caverns and abandoned mines. They build outdoor structures when necessary such as the suacer-shaped buildings at and near active mining sites. Mustafarian structures are strongly reinforced and armored against natural calamities, making the larger facilities on Mustafar decidedly fortress like in construction and durability.\n[P]There is comparatively little life on Mustafar's surface, and not much more underground. The northern Mustafarians use large insect creatures called lava fleas to move rapidly on the surface in great leaps and bounds. Underground, Mustafarians hunt strong hardshelled, burrowing quadruped creatures called krishels through labyrinths of seemingly never-ending caverns and tunnels. Mustafarians cultivate few crops, lacking the water to support traditional farms even underground. Various types of edible fungi and domesticated herds of large insectoid creatures make up much of the Mustafarian diet. Despite these challenges, Mustafar is largely self-sufficient in regards to its food supply, unlike many other hotbeds of industry across the galaxy.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Mustafarians have their own language, which has developed very precise ways to express concepts relating to the natural features above and below ground, especially those phenomena that are deceptively dangerous. The Mustafarian subspecies have different dialects, but though some terms and cultural concepts also differ, any two individuals can communicate on a functional level.\n[P]Mustafarians are capable of speaking Basic and other common galactic languages, but other than the ones who work in the Mining Guild operations and deal with outsiders by necessity, most do not bother to learn Basic. Mustafarians who live or travel off-world almost always speak Basic and sometimes the language of their trading partners. Given their history with the Techno Union, they are more likely to know languages regularly used among the former Seperatist Worlds.\n[P][B]Life on the Fringe:[b]Most Mustafarians' lack of interest in the galaxy means they are disinclined to leave their homeworld. Business pursuits and trade negotiations do drive some Mustafarians to leave their world. Mustafarians merchants and Mining Guild personnel make regular trips to trade for upgrades in protective technology and equipment, as well as to deliver ore to buyers.\n[P]Some Mustafarians seek full-time employment off-world in the ranks of corporations, criminal syndicates, and trade rings. Given their cultural focus on survival against a harsh universe, many Mustarians have few qualms taking on work that most members of many other species would find overly risky, unethical, or unfathomably boring. Mustafarians find most inhabited worlds cold, but relish the relish the relative safety.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 24 - Special Modifications[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Brawl":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"MUSTAFARIAN"}},"_id":"VV7nB23sjXbh5F7h"}
{"name":"Iktotchi","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/IKTOTCHI.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Iktotchi[h4]\n[P]Hailing from the Expansion Region, Iktotchi are immediately recognizable by the downwards-curving horns that sprout from the sides of their heads. Despite their distinct and memorable physical appearance, their species is most renowned for a trait not visible to the naked eye: precognition. Their seemingly supernatural precognitive abilities once made the Iktotchi particularly interesting to both the old Jedi Order and to various organizations as top-tier pilots. Despite their potent gifts, few Iktotchi leave their world to interact with outsiders.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b]On a basic level, Iktotchi follow what many consider to be the standard pattern of sentients in the galaxy: two legs, two arms, and a head, all connected by a torso. They stand approximately 1.8 meters high on average and typically have a brown, orange or pink hue to their skin. In modern society, their twin horns serve no major practical purpose. The horns of male Iktotchi tend to grow larger than those of female Iktotchi. though this is by no means an exact indicator of any individual's sex or gender.  Should an Iktotchi's horns become damaged, they grow back over time in most cases. Also notable are their hands, which are almost half again as large as most similarly sized species, with relatively thick fingers. Members of the species enjoy a 90-year life expectancy, given ideal conditions.  \n[P]Iktotchi possess precognitive abilities that they can hone through training, although these are considerably reduced in effectiveness away from their homeworld, the desolate moon called Iktotch. Some Iktotchi have also reported to possess telepathic capabilities, but whether these Iktotchi actually have a gift for reading minds or can simply extrapolate others' thoughts by perceiving the future remains unclear to xenobiologists. To the Iktotchi themselves, for whom time does not appear as linear as it does to other species, the practical distinction between clairvoyance and telepathy is often blurry or irrelevant. Most humans do not seek to understand the biological principles that allow their eyes to transform light into coherent images; to most Iktotchi, precognition is as important yet mundane as sight. Iktotchi who hone their gift of foresight can grow extremely skilled as seers, however, and can often hold positions of prestige in society.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Iktotchi society can be disconcerting to outsiders, especially if they come unprepared for its unique quirks. Although Iktotchi still use spoken language, the capacity to know what others will say before they say it means Iktotchi  society is disturbingly quiet  to members of most other species. Nonnative used to livelier gatherings may find the hushed conversations of the Iktotchi offputting. Additionally, the gift of precognition makes direct confrontation far less prevalent in society. Interpersonal  and military conflicts are resolved in the mind's eye rather than through force of arms, and most Iktotchi are cautious in action.\n[P]The Iktotchi have enjoyed a unified, representatively-democratic government for almost their entire history. Apart from appearing threatening and unapproachable to outsiders (and being banned from most gambling halls across the galaxy), the Iktotchi enjoy a positive reputation. The world and society are known for their relative tranquility in a tumultuous galaxy. In fact, despite their fearsome appearance, most Iktotchi choose not to venture out into the wider, more dangerous galaxy when offered a change to leave placid Iktotch.\n[P]with the (to the Iktotchi, unsurprising) advent of the Empire, almost all Iktotchi returned to their homeworld, where giant orbital stations were built to accommodate the sudden influx of returning citizens. Since then, the Iktotchi have adopted an isolationist policy, and the Empire has been content to leave them to their own devices rather than deal with their strange abilities on the galactic stage.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Iktotchi homeworld is a moon named Iktotch, which orbits around the gas giant Iktotchon. Located within the Narvath sector of the Expansion Region, the moon's days are twenty-two hours long, and an Iktotchian year comprises of 418 days. Arid, rocky and windy, the moon can seem a harsh environment to newcomers, but the Iktotchi themselves are well adapted to the climate and find it comfortable. The moon's gravity falls within a standard deviation of the norm, and the weather is reasonably fair, aside from the frequent windstorms. One surprising feature of the moon is a large Republic crest, visible from space. This massive symbol is preserved as a remnant from the days when the Iktotchi foresaw the arrival of the Old Republic vessel that would offer them the chance to join the Republic. These forebears responded accordingly, carving the symbol to welcome the representatives of the Republic.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Iktotchi speak Iktotchese to eachother. In comparison to other languages, Iktotchese is a fairly straight-forward language. It lacks the variance and complex double meanings found in most other tongues. Xenolinguists tend to assume this stems from the fact that the precognitive Iktotchi can see through most misdirections and duplicity. Despite its relative simplicity, the language is complete, though it often incorporates loan-words, especially after contact with the Old Republic. Iktotchi typically have no difficulty learning and communicating in Basic.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] The Iktotchi have a long tradition of seers who hone their innate precognitive abilities, which the Jedi Order took a particular interest in when Iktotch joined the Old Republic. The Jedi soon discovered that even rudimentary training in the Force increases the potency of an Iktotchi's precognitive abilities dramatically.\n[P]During the days of the Republic the Iktotchi produced their fair share of Jedi Knights (as well as other types of Force users) who used their natural talents to augment the already impressive powers granted by the Force. To beings who can intuitively grasp future events, the Force might not seem as mystica and unknowable as it does to other species, but thanks to their acquaintance with prophecy, the Iktotchi have a deep respect for the power of the Force. The Jedi the Iktotchi have produced are often viewed as heroes. Even in the era of the Empire, these champions are remembered fondly on Iktotch, if spoken of infrequently and in hushed words.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Precognition : In addition to seeing flashes of the future at the GM's discretion, an Iktotchi may spend [TR] on an Initiative check to perform a free maneuver, or have an ally within short range perform a free maneuver, before the encounter begins.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Keeping the Peace[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Vigilance":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"IKTOTCHI"}},"_id":"VWVAIr3U0jk7h29r"}

Their most distinctive features are long ears and feet and buck teeth. Native to the planet Coachelle Prime, their high reproductive rate forced them to colonize the entire star system to avoid overcrowding. The Lepus carnivorus are typically gregarious individuals, although prone to bursts of anger if their family or species are insulted. Lepi are constantly in motion and are known for their speed.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Lepus carnivorus are sentient bipedal lagomorphs with large ears and feet. They have lanky frames, with males averaging 1.9 meters in height, while the smaller females average 1.6 meters. The strong legs of the Lepi are capable of great speeds as well as delivering powerful kicks, often used in fights to bludgeon their opponents. Lepi are covered in short fur that ranged in color from green to dark blue to white. Lepi also have tails, although these differ in length from stubby to quite long.\n\n[P]The Lepus carnivorus have large eyes—likely adapted for dark warrens—which give them sharp vision. That occasionally leads to the misconception that Lepi consume space carrots, which are known to improve eyesight. However, most Lepi prefer various forms of meat, such as hambones. Some Lepi even claim to be carnivorous. A number of long whiskers grow from their short snouts. Long incisors, occasionally referred to as \"buck teeth,\" jut from their jaws, useful in their omnivorous diets. The long ears of the Lepi are very sensitive and occasionally colored in different shades, such as pink fur.\n\n[P]The Lepus carnivorus have a very high metabolism such that they are virtually always in motion, giving them an appearance of flightiness. That skittishness is also influenced by their evolution from high-strung herbivores; their \"fight-or-flight\" instinct very much favored flight.\n\n[P]Lepus carnivorus sexually mature around age ten, when they are considered young adults. Females give birth in prodigious numbers; mothers often have up to three dozen offspring in their lifespan. Lepi reach old age around sixty to seventy-four, after which they are considered venerable.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Lepus carnivorus society revolves around the vast warrens they build under the surface of their planets. Larger families live in their own smaller burrows. Lepi are fiercely loyal and proud of their families. They are quick to anger and prone to violence, especially in reaction to insults to their family or species. Their awkward appearance make them prone to mockery, and they are particularly sensitive to being referred to as rodents. However, as a whole, Lepi are typically a gregarious species, quick witted with a strong sense of humor.\n\n[P]The Lepi are often curious and impulsive, leading many to seek out adventure far from their homeworlds. That also stems from a desire to rise above the insults they often receive. It is common among Lepi to find a determination to achieve great deeds not only for personal fame, but also to redeem their species in the eyes of the galaxy.\n\n[P]Little is known of Lepi religion, but their exclamation \"heavenly hutches\" suggested belief in an afterlife. Some Lepi also carried lucky charms.\n\n[P]Lepi names were typically one word, with examples including Augdon, Gagen, Javilla, Lupher, Maximort, Nevlin, Roonis, Saper, Zylo, and Trixx.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Coachelle Prime is a planet in the Mid Rim, not far from the Centrality.  It is home to the rabbit-like Lepi, who live underground in massive warrens.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The native language, both written and oral, of the Lepi is Lepese, or Lepp. However, that quickly became secondary to Basic as the language of preference.

In addition to their partial Force-resistance, they are resistant to radiation. They also have an ability to dissipate heat which made them hard to detect using standard life-form sensors.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Thanks to their Force-immunity, Dashade warriors easily found employment as combat instructors for the Jedi and assassins for the Sith.

Though they are similar in appearance to humans, their one noticeable difference comprises their extended, almost cone-like skulls, which house large, binary brains (in essence, two brains closely linked together). Because of their binary brains, members of this humanoid species can simultaneously pursue multiple lines of thought and have extraordinary mental aptitude. The species is also known for attention to detail as well as a cultural tendency toward extended contemplation. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Cereans are mammalian, with anatomy very similar to that of humans. The most notable differences are the presence of the enlarged, conical cranium—to accommodate the binary brain structure—as well as a pair of hearts to improve blood circulation. Cereans are generally regarded as somewhat less physically coordinated than humans. \n\n[P]Cereans exhibit an unusual sexual dimorphism. Female births outnumber male births by a ratio of twenty to one. Further, males age more rapidly than females. Consequently, female Cereans dominate the world's population. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Cerean culture is focused on preserving the undamaged portions of their homeworid and living in harmony with the natural world. Meditation is a central part of their lives, often in conjunction with kasha crystals. These stones aid in calming and cleansing the mind, helping users to harness their natural energies. \n[P]Partly due to their imbalanced sexual ratio. Cerean society is primarily matriarchal. The government is ruled by a president who works with a Council of Elders. Decisions are made only after lengthy discussions that thoroughly analyze both sides of an issue, with concerted efforts toward achieving objectivity. Notably, once the council makes a resolution, its decision is final, with no opportunity for appeal. Cereans believe so absolutely in their infallibility that they assume all decisions made by the council are correct. Revisiting such a decision may only happen due to changing circumstances or new. previously unknown information. \n\n[P]Tradition plays a major role in Cerean life. This begins with an individual's name. Most Cereans have three names, derived from their parents and grandparents. Clothing styles are also highly traditional, established over centuries. Many Cereans train in the use of an ancient, curved sword known as the shyam. Duelists often focus on a highly artistic and stylized combat style as a means of releasing their aggression.

They are renowned for empathetic and cheerful natures and for enjoying everyday activities. Though generally peaceful, they are also tough and strong. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Nautolans are a naively aquatic humanoid species capable of breathing underwater. Webbed toes and fingers aid them in swimming through the depths. A dense cartilaginous support network combines with a bony endoskeleton to make them exceptionally tough. Lengthy green tendrils emerge from their heads, serving as sensory organs that detect the pheromones of nearby sentients. Their large black eyes are adapted to pierce the murkiest underwater environments. However, Nautolans are capable of surviving for extended periods on dry land. \n\n[P]Nautolans are an egg-laying species. When hatching, they emerge from the eggs as tadpoles. Arms, legs, and head-tails begin to emerge during the second year of life, at which point they are roughly the same size as a human infant. Initially, these limbs are not strong enough to support their weight on land, so most spend their early years in aquatic environments. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] An elected Council of Elders forms the centralized government for Nautolan settlements. On Glee Anselm, representatives from each settlement cooperate to form an overarching centralized government. Notably, ''elder\" is a title of respect, as representatives are elected based upon merit rather than age. \n\n[P]Nautolans mate for life and are extremely loyal to their families. Both parents contribute equally to raising their young. Historically, Nautolan parents arranged marriages for their children, but in modern times this has become much less common. \n\n[P]Nautolan moods often reflect those of nearby sentients due to the pheromone sensitivity of their tendrils.

However, when confronted with anger or despair, members of this empathetic species are prone to respond in kind. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Glee Anselm is a Mid Rim world filled with a broad range of aquatic environments. Its few landmasses are largely archipelagos. While Nautolans evolved in Glee Anselm's oceans, another unrelated species—the Anselmi—arose to dwell upon its landmasses. Constant fighting over the land turned the Anselmi into a warlike people. This has led to many conflicts throughout the world's history. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Nautolans' native language is Nautila, which was originally created for underwater use. In atmosphere, the language is largely unpronounceable, as it is dependent upon pheromones that are dispersed through the water in conjunction with spoken sounds.

They are sometimes called Snaggletooths due to their protruding jaws and short fangs. Because they come from a planet with a cold environment, evolution gave them thick skin instead of fur. Due to their oversized snouts, Snivvians make excellent scouts and trackers. Most Snivvians choose to speak Basic as well as a diverse range of secondary languages. Some refuse to let go of their native tongue for symbolic, subtextual, or fashionable reasons.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Their physiology is indicative of their environment, although it is somewhat unusual. The harsh, frigid conditions on Cadomai have given them thick skin instead of heavy fur. This skin is formed of special membranes that open and close pores to regulate heat loss, in response to temperature differences. Snivvians don't sweat, since their skin doesn't exude moisture. They also don't suffer from frostbite.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Snivvians are among the most renowned artists and authors in the galaxy. Their homeworld of Cadomai Prime has extremely cold temperatures and long winters, forcing the Snivvians to live long periods of time in subterranean caverns. During those long days, Snivvians develop their artistic talents and sensibilities. They produce masterpieces in holography, painting, sculpture, music, and the written word. Although technology would eventually lessen the need for this form of hibernation, Snivvians still feel the need—biologically and culturally—to continue the tradition. Many Snivvians travel throughout the galaxy in attempt to live the lives of the subjects of their future artistic works, even when it was dangerous.\n\n[P]Snivvians have a reputation for sociopathic tendencies similar to the Trandoshans, and they try to control their genetics in order to curtail such tendencies.

A frigid world with intolerably cold winters, Cadomai's tundra plains are home to the Snivvian species, who are renowned for their art. Cadomai also holds a large system of subterranean caverns, where the Snivvians make their homes during the subfreezing winters. Cadomai Prime possesses a single moon, and is part of the Cadomai system. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Snivvian is the native language of the Snivvian species from Cadomai Prime. Most Snivvians are fluent in both Snivvian and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language, and they have a nasal accent when speaking Basic. Snivvians are fascinated by galactic culture, and thus are happy to speak Basic with non-Snivvians. However, there are some Snivvians who refuse to use Basic because of their personal philosophy. In any case, all Snivvians are delighted to encounter members of other species trying to communicate in Snivvian.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Charm : Snivvian may begin the game with one free rank in Charm.</p><p>Cold Resistance : When making skill checks,\nSnivvians may remove [SETBACK][SETBACK]\nimposed due to cold environmental conditions.</p><p>Silhouette : Snivvians have a Silhouette of 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SNIVVIAN"}},"_id":"YXiCvuKnH4hiRkGV"}
{"_id":"YYxDorO8gnZhknel","name":"Besalisk","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/BESALISK.png","data":{"description":"<p>[H4]Besalisk[h4] The four-armed Besalisks are one of the larger species galactic travelers are likely to encounter on a semi-regular basis. Towering over and standing considerably wider at the shoulder than most humans, Besalisks tend to make an impression. Though their massive forms can seem threatening at first, many Besalisks are quick to laugh and slow to anger, at least compared to humans. [P]Besalisks live in major population centers across the galaxy and are scattered throughout the Outer Rim Territories, though rarely in large numbers. While by no means unintelligent, many Besalisks who travel the galaxy fail to recognize the seriousness or complexity of some situations in which they find themselves. Ojum is a relatively peaceful world, compared to many of the seedier planets in the Outer Rim, and many of the galaxy's dangers are strange. Of course, as with most species, Besalisks are quite capable of adapting to their environment, and so they learn to survive wherever they go, from the Core Worlds to the lawless fringes of the galaxy. [P]Besalisks are clever and motivated in their selected line of work. They make for natural machinists, and also succeed in other task oriented professions. Their large hands and bodies make fine, small-scale work challenging, and it is difficult for them to work in confined spaces. Employers often team Besalisk Technicians with human-sized individuals or droids to carry out work requiring fine detail and small parts. [P]Besalisk technical aptitude is well known among the Slicers and Mechanics of the galaxy. This reputation is especially pervasive in the Outer Rim, and among those operating in the penumbra between galactic society and the lawless fringe. Besalisks can be a natural fit for engineering jobs that require strength in addition to finesse. [P]However, Besalisks can be found in almost any line of work. In fact, they will often jump at the chance to pursue their own dreams or take advantage of lucrative opportunity to work for themselves, and are even known to abandon their position merely because they have grown bored. It is one thing to leave a corporate workforce or average job, but Besalisks abandoning a criminal syndicate or similar employer often don't understand the risks of offending their old boss. [P][B]Physiology:[b] Besalisks are burlier than members of most other humanoid species, average about 1.8 meters in height, and have thick limbs and a broad neck nearly the size of their wide heads. Their segmented, overlapping head ridge ends in a small beaklike feature where many humanoids have a form of nose. The beak reveals the Besalisk's avian heritage, though new observers could be forgiven for incorrectly perceiving their physical features reptilian. [P]Besalisks deviate from the form of most humanoid species in one major way; they have four powerful arms. One set of arms is primary and the other is secondary, typically acting in synchronized movements with the first pair. Much like other humanoids, Besalisks also generally have a primary hand; the remaining limbs are typically considered off-hands. THey rarely wear footwear, which tend to be unwieldy on their large, three-toed feet. They are adapted to the frigid weather of their homeworld, Ojum, and tend to perspire heavily in the climates preferred by many of the galaxy's more numerous species. [P]The Besalisk's considerable size is due to the species' development on Ojum. The Besalisks adapted to the cold, inhospitable conditions of life on the glaciers by evolving the ability to naturally store more food and water than most beings. The Besalisk metabolism typically requires a lot of food when they are active, however, storing what it can when food is plentiful. [P][B]Society:[b] Besalisks aren't much for complex governments or the sort of nation-states common to most advanced species. On Ojum, they live in small communities of a few thousand each, scattered across the multitude of mobile glaciers that float through the world's dominating oceans. Each community elects a leader who acts as its final arbiter of disputes, but that is the extent of their governing institutions. During the relatively warmer month, communities hold annual events, or conclaves, at which individuals participate in various social traditions, including mating rituals. [P]With their general aversion to centralized government, the Besalisks never had their own representative in the Galactic or Imperial Senates. They are highly autonomous and independent, which can pose a problem under Imperial rule. Threatened by potential Imperial or Imperial-condoned slaver, some communities have turned to others in the galaxy for protection, no matter how dubious its source might be. [P]Unfortunately, those willing to help the Besalisks typically operate on the shadier side of the law, and escaping from their so-called protection can be highly challenging. Payments are expensive, interest is high and there are continual costs to maintain \"services\". The Hutts in particular tend to exploit the situation until a community is no longer profitable. Some communities do eventually escape their \"protectors\", though only at a high cost. A few turn to violence when nothing else works. Though criminal cartels are often petty and cruel overlords, bloodshed in sufficient quantity can be cad enough for business to make them pack up and leave. [P][B]Homeworld:[b] Traveling to the Besalisk homeworld of Ojum is challenging, as it rests within the Deep Core of the galaxy. Upon his ascension, the Emperor established the Deep Core Security Zone, which makes travel virtually impossible without Imperial permits and approvals, which are difficult obtain and invite harsh Imperial scrutiny. However, since Ojum lies relatively close to the edge of the Deep Core, the Hutts and other nefarious organizations that wish to exploit the Besalisks have found ways around some of the security measures. A few know of dangerous secret hyperspace routes, variations of which date back to the days of the Republic. Many take a more direct approach and simply bribe the proper Imperial authorities to issue the necessary permits. These bureaucrats are generally stationed on worlds far from the Deep Core, and care little for the Besalisks. [P]Orbiting space stations provide the main meeting points for the Besalisks and outside visitors. While most have at least a token form of Imperial security, many security officers are heavily influenced by the Besalisks' nefarious protectors. As such, they are highly useful for those involved in less than legal pursuits. Travelers find the stations to be much more welcoming than Ojum's cold, harsh weather. [P][B]Language: The Besalisks' native language is composed of sharp noises that resemble low grunts and series of barks. It is rare to hear it outside of Ojum, as Besalisks have no trouble learning and using Basic. Visitors rarely learn it themselves, even if they are able to create the proper sounds. Typical translator droids have the Besalisk language readily available, though it can be startling and surreal to hear it from a droid. [P][B]Life on the Fringe:[b] Besalisks living elsewhere in the galaxy often lead relatively solitary lives, though there is the occasional commune that has taken up a nomadic, deep-space existence. While their home-world isn't the most technologically advanced in the galaxy, Besalisks have an aptitude and creativity that makes them well-suited to a wide variety of jobs. [P]Besalisks can be found in almost any vocational position, from cantina owner to captain of a ship. Some Besalisks earn good credits as enforcers or security personnel simply based on their size and the number of intimidating weapons they can carry at once, even if most would be hard-pressed to fire more than one of these deadly firearms at a time. It is hard to brush off any threat backed by four oversized blasters. Of course, many Besalisks pursue more mundane jobs. Besalisk lawyers, doctors, traders and entrepreneurs can be found on many worlds across the galaxy. [P]Besalisks fall among the many species in the galaxy that are recognizable tot he average Imperial citizen but rarely encounters. Self-styled Imperial nobility and other highly placed individuals are easily offended by Besalisk manners, such as they are. For their part, most Besalisk's don't care much about the petty disdain of such self-important people.</p>\n<h4>Abilities</h4>\n<p>Cold Conditions : When making skill checks, Besalisks may remove [SETBACK] imposed due to arctic or cold environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>Extra Limbs : Besalisks may spend [ADVANTAGE][ADVANTAGE] on a successful Brawl attack to hit a second target engaged with it, dealing the same damage as dealt to the original target.</p>\n<p><em>Source: Special Modifications, Page 20</em></p>","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Resilience":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"BESALISK","loaded":false}}}
{"name":"Ithorian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/ITHORIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Ithorian[h4]\n\nIn Basic, Ithorians are called Hammerheads (though the nickname is not to their liking), as they possess one of the most unique head structures of any known biped. Ithorians are often considered the caretakers of the galaxy, so profound is their love of natural environments of all kinds and their desire to repair the damage sentient beings do to their worlds. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Ithorians have long, spindly bodies (ranging from 1.8 to 2.3 meters in height) and long fingers. At the top of an Ithorian's torso, the neck and head emerge as a continuous, curved structure that reaches forward and ends with a vaguely \"T\"-shaped protrusion. The Ithorian's eyes are large, inset orbs on either end of the structure's \"T.\" Back near where the neck emerges from the torso, there is a mouth on either side. With four throats and these two mouths, Ithorians have the capacity to speak and sing in stereo. They possess powerful sonic abilities that can, with effort, be used offensively. \n\n[P]Males and females are primarily distinguished by the humps on the backs of their heads; one for a male, two for a female. Their young, called \"pupae,\" are spawned by the thousands from a single male. At this early stage, Ithorians have no limbs, moving around by use of locomotion tubes, All of this changes after their metamorphosis into young adults. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Ithorian society is one based on a spiritual connection to \"Mother Jungle,\" which is how they refer to the spirit of their lush, rainforest-covered planet of Ithor. The entire civilization is dedicated to never desecrating the planet; as soon as they had access to repulsorlift technology, the Ithorians built giant floating communities—called herdships—that allow them to float above and travel across their planet while minimizing their impact on its pristine beauty. \n\n[P]Ithorians have carried this collective mentality with them out into the stars, adapting their herdship concept to interstellar travel. Each such herd, as they refer to their social groupings and extended families, is led by a Force-sensitive priest. This makes them anathema to Emperor Palpatine and his Empire. The only reason the planet has remained relatively untouched is due to the Empire's extortion of agricultural technology and other secrets from the Ithorians in return for abstaining from destroying the planetary surface. \n\n[P]Ithorians are even more pacifistic than Gran, as a general rule; they intentionally weed out aggressive members of their species by exiling them from Ithor (which is why many people have their first encounter with atypically violent or ill-tempered Ithorians). Usually eschewing weapons, an Ithorian typically defends himself with his sonic bellow abilities. lthorians out among the stars seek roles as artists, traders, and environmentalists. In this latter role, many Ithorians have acted to help restore ecological devastation done to other planets, usually as the result of one war or another. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Ithor is considered one of the most beautiful and life-filled worlds in the galaxy. It is covered in crystal blue oceans and emerald rainforests. All traces of civilization have been systematically removed from the planet's surface by the Ithorians, who live above it in their city-sized herdships. Individuals who choose to go to the surface are expected to reside there forever after, heeding the call of \"Mother Jungle.\" \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Considered one of the most complex and beautiful languages in the galaxy, Ithorese is a stereophonic melange of sounds that is a wonder to hear. Mastery of it by non-Ithorians is considered an incredible talent, as it is exceptionally difficult to manage without the unique qualities of Ithorian biology.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Bellow : With two mouths and four throats, Ithorians have a unique natural weapon they can call upon when threatened.

{"name":"Lannik","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/LANNIK.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Lannik[h4]\n[P]Though short in stature, Lanniks have done more than their fair share in shaping the galaxy and have produced heroes whose legends still resound from one end of known space to the other. Perhaps the most notable Lannik champion to be lauded across the galaxy in recent history was the Jedi Master Even Piell who served during the Clone Wars, but other Lanniks have also made their way into stories of valor. Their physical appearance makes them instantly recognizable, and although few members venture away from their home planet, those who do frequently accomplish noteworthy deeds. The Lannik species has earned a well-deserved reputation for hotheadedness and effectiveness in combat. As a result, the few members of the species who live off their homeworld are frequently in high demand for mercenary and enforcement work. However, while some Lanniks do fight for money or glory alone, many Lanniks live by strong ancient principles of honor and prefer to serve a righteous cause.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Lanniks are relatively short compared to the majority of sentient species, with an average height of around 1.2 meters. Their most noticeable physical features are their large, droopy ears, which afford the Lanniks acute hearing. Their skin tone varies across a surprisingly broad spectrum, from pink to orange to dark red, and often features strong blue or purple tones. Theoretically, a Lannik's lifespan is considerably longer than a human's, but given the common living conditions and lifestyle, not enough data is available to predict a true average age in ideal conditions.\n[P][B]Society:[b] To outsiders, Lannik society seems incredibly volatile and belligerent. Lanniks have a long history of violence against the large natural predators of their homeworld as well as eachother. Many Lanniks follow warrior traditions or codes of honor that date back centuries, if not millennia, and the Lannik homeworld is constantly in turmoil. As a consequence, most LAnniks can expect a life full of strife and deprivation. Although the world's politics were already highly unstable, the arrival of galactic explorers, bringing with them technology to the militant Lanniks, brought a fresh wave of civil and internecine wars, hastily formed treaties and localized skirmishes. The various clans and leaders tried to dictate how the new machinery would be integrated into their society planetwide, without success. The ripples of these early feuds can still be felt thousands of years later, as Lannik society seems no closer to peace.\n[P]Lanniks have traditionally been ruled by a monarchy, with a High Court sitting directly below the reigning ruler. As may be expected, the line of rulers is far from unbroken, and the ruling family must constantly fear assassins, terrorists, and rival factions striving for control by any means. Although a large majority of the population hods tactics such as hostage-taking and bombings to be dishonorable, some Lanniks desire power more than to abide by what they view as archaic taboos.\n[P]The sudden introduction of advanced technology long ago created an opening for criminal elements, and many such organizations still operate on the Lannik homeworld, tracing their roots directly back to that point in history. Although they expend most of their energy working against each other, these gangs still cause enough problems to thwart any efforts to stabilize Lannik society. At this point, these institutions are so deeply entrenched that it seems unlikely they will ever be fully uprooted. It is unsurprising, then, that many Lanniks who venture into the galaxy do so out of frustration at the state of their tumultuous homeworld.\n[P]Warriors in Lannik culture tend to adopt a single topknot as a hairstyle. This leads many outsiders, having encountered only the more warlike members of the species, to falsely believe that the style is common species-wide. Lanniks tend to not give facial cues or expressions when conversing and their default stance often makes them appear angry to other species. Individuals who befriend Lanniks quickly learn to pay more heed to vocal tone and other cues.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The planet Lannik lies within the Lannik space sector in the Mid Rim, easily accessible by the Bothan Run trade route. The planet is rich in minerals, ores, and other natural resources that have been barely exploited due too the difficulty of establishing safe sites without offending a half-dozen Lannik factions, legitimate or criminal. The planet is well known for both its deserts and its deeply forested mountainous terrain, both of which contain an intimidating number of apex predators. Though Lannik features numerous large cities, on average the development of these metropolises pales in comparison to that of similarly populated planets across the galaxy. Once again, the constant strife has made progress and organized expansion extremely slow. From a technical standpoint, the planet is quite livable, but the behavior of its citizens ensures that few outsiders ever voluntarily visit Lannik.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Lannik language (simply called \"Lannik\") is deliberately spoken in soft tones. This often surprises outsiders, who often expect such a warlike society to be full of loud proclamations and noisy arguments, but given the sensitive hearing that Lanniks possess, any increase in volume is considered both uncouth and highly insulting. Thus, their language contains a high proportion of soft and sibilant sounds. The Lanniks themselves find Basic to be relatively easy to learn and use, but they often speak at volumes so low that members of other species strain to understand them. Lanniks who spend enough time offworld usually overcome this tendency given time, but because it is a lifelong habit, it can be all too easy for them to slip back into this lower register. Similarly, Lanniks who have been offworld for years know not to be offended by the boisterous chatter of other species.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] For a long period of time, the Jedi Order found it challenging to properly test for Force sensitivity among the Lanniks. The ongoing wars and feuds made it extremely difficult to perform any kind of survey of individuals. Eventually, the Jedi found ways to conduct their tests without offending the locals, leading to the emergence of several prominent Lannik Jedi over the years. During the era of the Republic, and even in the age of the Empire, most Lanniks are too concerned with issues on their homeworld to engage in what seems like an intangible, unpredictable phenomenon. Jedi Master Even Piell's martial renown, however, did convince a number of Lanniks that the study of the Force was a worthwhile and noble pursuit.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Indomitable : A Lannik removes up to [SE][SE] caused by Critical Injuries, the disoriented condition, and fear from all checks he makes.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Keeping the Peace[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Streetwise":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"LANNIK"}},"_id":"Z67hrmujh6Zvoc2x"}

Droids serve a variety of roles on the fringe, including security and conflict resolution, surgery and medicine, mechanical repairs, construction, astrogation and piloting, and mechanical labor. While many of these droids have only rudimentary intelligence, some are capable of independent thought. \n\n[H3]PLAYING A DROID[h3] \n\n[P]Creating droid characters in [B]Edge of the Empire[b] is easy. Treat them as a separate species, with bonuses and abilities that reinforce their robotic natures. Players should be creative when coming up with their description, and also with how the droid uses its equipment. Instead of a droid wearing Laminate Armor, for example, it could have reinforced metal plates attached directly to its chassis, and instead of carrying a blaster pistol, it could have one built into its arm. \n\n[P]The personality of a droid is a more delicate matter. The very fact that the droid is a Player Character means that it is self-aware and independent-minded (unless the player wants to play a character who is completely subservient to the surrounding biologicals, of course). Players who want to make a droid character should remember the droid's origins and try to incorporate elements of their original function into their personality, even if their droid character has taken on roles far beyond what he was originally pro\ngrammed for.

Aside from such tall tales, droids do not have their own society, instead laboring within the society of their human and non-human masters. Unless a droid's personality has reprogrammed its cogni-tive faculties, droids are built to obey, and they do. \n\n[P]However, the droids played by PCs present a special case.

{"name":"Dowutin","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/DOWUTIN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Dowutin[h4]\nThe Dowutins are a long-lived species of muscle-bound humanoids. So extensive are their life spans, in fact, it is said that no Dowutin has ever died of old age, instead falling in battle or succumbing to the many perils of Dowut. Whether this is true or a myth perpetuated by Dowutin boasting is difficult to say. It is certain, however, that Dowutins are among the strongest and toughest sentients in the galaxy. For these reasons, they are highly sought as soldiers, mercenaries, and bodyguards. However, Dowutin arrogance is often just as immense, and few condescend to serve what they perceive as weaker beings.\n[P]Alongside their incredible longevity, Dowutins possess a complementary trait even rarer among sentients: they never stop growing. By the time Dowutins are old enough to fend for themselves, they rival the most robust specimens of many species. During their second decade, typical Dowutins can rival most Wookiees in stature and fortitude. A Dowutin in its fifth century is a tower of muscle and horn weighing as much as a metric ton.\n[P]Dowutins prize physical strength and vigor, but in a very different way than most sentient species. For a Dowutin, strength and even combat training are not matters of pride, but matters of pragmatism; on Dowut, those with strength and skill get the resources and respect they are due. Many Dowutins who leave their homeworld are surprised and confused by the criteria the rest of the galaxy uses to assign authority, political power, and leadership positions. More than one Dowut in has had difficulty adapting and found themselves in deep trouble for it.\n[P]Most Dowutins are solitary by choice, although this does not stop a Dowutin from joining forces with others when expedient. Rare, however, are Dowutins who stoop to taking orders from beings smaller or weaker than themselves. Many sentients who find themselves working with Dowutins learn to frame directives as suggestions or even questions, even when they are technically or practically in a position to issue orders or guidance. In some cases, others find it necessary to leave Dowutins under the impression they are in charge, if for no other reason than to keep operations running smoothly.\n[P]Dowutins have a reputation for being unfriendly, even irritable. Although deserved, this too stems from the species' unusual perspective. Dowutins are as direct in their speech as in any other undertaking, and most have no qualms against speaking the truth as they see it, no matter how harsh it might be. A typical Dowutin simply does not see the point in mincing words. Obfuscation and deception, even to avoid giving offense, complicate matters and cause problems. Many who interact with Dowutins also assume the species incapable of humor. Although this is not strictly true, Dowutins rarely suffer fools. The sorts of misunderstandings, mishaps, ironies, and even quips that others might find amusing, a typical Dowutin sees only as annoying.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Dowutins are large and muscular, with tough, leathery hides ranging from yellow to deep brown. Although humanoid in form, Dowutins have as much in common with banthas and dewbacks as with any human or near-human species. Vestigial tusks, although ineffective as weapons, are a reminder of the Dowutins' ancestors, omnivorous herd beasts that roamed the frigid plains of Dowut. These tusks helped the creatures to forage for roots, insects, and hibernating feeks. Dowutins are more sophisticated in their diets, and many put their great strength and stamina to use as hunters, rather than as foragers.\n[P]Dowutins' fingers end in thick, tough spikes-the word \"claw\" hardly does them justice-made of the same bony material as their tusks. Although problematic for delicate manual tasks, these talons provide an effective means of self-defense and even augment the Dowutins' considerable strength, whether for prying apart bulkhead doors or dismantling a troublesome droid bare-handed.\n[P]In support of their immense frames and continuing development, Dowutins have exceptional appetites, consuming as much as half their body weight in a day. For Dowutins abroad in the galaxy, obtaining adequate food can pose a challenge-for themselves and for cantinas, tapcafs, and other nearby food vendors.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The omnivorous ancestors of the Dowutins lived in migratory herds, traversing the frozen plains of Dowut in search of the considerable sustenance required for such large beasts. Despite their origins, Dowutins have evolved as primarily solitary beings. They have little use for family bonds, and are left to fend for themselves on their own at a young age. Juveniles must learn to survive and hunt in the harsh climate of Dowut or perish.\n[P]Similarly, Dowutins have little use for organized municipalities. Their simple cities exist for convenience alone. Outsiders often view Dowutin civilization as barbaric and primitive, but the Dowutins' pragmatism, straightforward approach, and uncompromising self-reliance have allowed them to thrive with few of the institutions most worlds rely on.\n[P]For Dowutins, might makes right. The Dowutin legal system, such as it is, resolves disputes primarily through contests of strength-that is, in those relatively rare cases when the concerned parties do not simply settle matters themselves Immediately with a good fist fight. However, while usually quick to ire, Dowutins seldom hold grudges. For the average Dowutin, the concept of revenge serves no purpose. Neither do Dowutins bother with avenging wrongs against members of their extended clan: they believe that wronged parties should be strong enough to take care of themselves.\n[P]Dowut's relative anarchy has left its population vulnerable in the era of the Galactic Empire. Due to their physiques and hardiness, Dowutins stand out to many Imperial officials as desirable slaves. The Dowutins' fierce spirits and arrogance, and the very physical qualities for which they are prized, have ensured few successful enslavements. However, their resistance at both individual and cultural levels has resulted in one of the most intensive and oppressive Imperial crackdowns in the galaxy. Traditionally largely independent, Dowut now suffers from an indefinite Imperial blockade. For the most part, the notoriously self-reliant Dowutins are little affected by this arrangement as long as they avoid any personal entanglements with Imperials.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The planet of Dowut lies in the Core, not far from the Unknown Regions. Orbiting at a considerable distance from its ternary star system. Dowut is a frigid, harsh world. Dowutins must be strong and resilient to survive on their planet's windswept tundra. Competition for resources and game is fierce, and Dowutins must be wary of the same ravenous predators that threatened the herds of their ancestors. The vegetation on Dowut is as hardy and practical as the inhabitants. Thorny vines climb up icy cliff faces, and tough scrub claws into the frozen soil. Herds of large beasts not unlike the Dowutins' ancestors traverse the tundra, as gor-cats and packs of nabirs pick off the weakest specimens and those that fall behind.\n[P]The Dowutins have generally avoided politics as much as possible. Although Dowut joined the Republic several centuries ago, a Dowutin Senator made an appearance on Coruscant only a handful of times. Even at the height of the Clone Wars, the Dowut seat was vacant the majority of the time.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Dowuta language consists largely of deep, booming vocalizations with thundering reverberations. It is difficult, if not impossible, for most other species to emulate the sounds required to speak Dowuta, and attempts are among the few things to draw forth a typical Dowutin's sense of humor.\n[P]Most Dowutins speak only their native tongue, seeing little need to learn Basic-if a weaker being comes to Dowut to communicate, it is the offworlder's responsibility to find a method of communication. However, Dowutins who travel abroad by choice almost invariably learn Basic. Even a Dowutin with years of experience speaks Basic with a thunderous bass. Most Dowutins find whispering impossible, and the roar of an angry or excited Dowutin poses a serious threat to the ears of those close by.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Raised to depend only on their own strength and resourcefulness, few Dowutins find appealing the concept of an energy field that binds together all living things. Consequently, only a handful of Dowutins were members of the Jedi Order throughout its history. However, there is no evidence that Dowutins are less sensitive to the Force as a species than any other. It is more likely that the majority of Force-sensitive Dowutins simply fail-or refuse-to recognize their ability.\n[P]Though few Dowutins ever trained as Jedi, those who did witness the Jedi in battle often developed a great respect for the Jedi's strength. In fact, such encounters preceded the recruitment of the majority of Dowutin Jedi, since only a Dowutin fully convinced of the power and skill of a smaller being would deign to release its offspring in to Jedi custody. Dowutins inducted into the order would continue their Padawan training far past the time their kin on Dowut had set out on their own.\n[P]Despite the scarcity of Dowutins in the Jedi's history, the species' great strength ensured their success as Warriors, even if some had difficulty with the subtler aspects of lightsaber combat. Any Dowutins seeking to follow the path of the Jedi must take pains, however, to unlearn many of their traditional ways. The Dowutin propensity for violence and arrogance can be a great asset in battle, but taken too far can lead to the dark sid e of the Force. Even greater susceptibility lies in the traditional Dowutin view of power and authority. A being with such beliefs who taps into the power of the Force is certain to find tempting the limitless strength it can offer. Taken to their extreme. such views bear a troubling resemblance to those of the Sith.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Normal : Dowutin may start the game with a silhouette of 1.</p><p>Immovable : Dowutins who suffer the immobilized condition, are knocked prone, or are otherwise moved against their will may, as an out-of-turn incidental, suffer 3 strain to avoid the effect.

{"name":"Whiphid","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/WHIPHID.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Whiphid[h4]\n\nWhiphids are tall, muscled, furred sentient beings from the planet Toola. They are notable for their great tusks. On Toola, Whiphids live a primitive lifestyle, hunting caraboose and other large animals, such as the motmot, their favored prey. Their language consists of approximately six thousand words. As Whiphids came into contact with more technically advanced races that came to Toola to buy ice, they began to show great curiosity about the rest of the galaxy. Many Whiphids left Toola, supporting themselves as big game hunters, mercenaries, or bounty hunters.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Whiphids average about 2.5 meters and can weigh up to 400 kilos. They are covered by long yellow-white or gold fur and had stubby fur-covered tails. Their faces are elongated, with prominent foreheads and long, bowed cheekbones. A Whiphid's face is furless apart from a few hairs on the lips and chin. Two large tusks protrude from the lower jaw, and their massive arms end with thick three-fingered hands, the fingers ending in sharp claws. Female Whiphids tend to be slightly shorter and heavier than the males. Their eyes protrude slightly from their heads. Young Whiphids have shorter snouts and far less fur than adults.\n\n[P]Since their homeworld of Toola is a cold planet of ice and snow, the Whiphid's body maintains a thick layer of blubber, which serves to insulate and reduce heat loss. Their thick fur also helps to protect them from the harsh climate and is also covered with natural oil that repels water and allows them to swim in Toola's frigid oceans. In the warmer periods of the spring and summer on Toola, the Whiphids lose several centimeters of fur and burn off much of their fat reserves. Their hollow cheekbones also widen slightly, since a broader face helps to dissipate heat. These biological changes are induced by warmer temperatures rather than by the cycle of the seasons. Whiphids in the wider galaxy, therefore, are more likely to have less fur and be smaller in size than their counterparts on their homeworld in winter.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] On Toola, the Whiphids live together in tribes of three to ten couples. In the winter the tribes are nomadic and travel across the icy plains of the planet in search of prey. They camp near hunting grounds using round hide tents. During summer the tribes move to a permanent base that is constructed of stone and covered by animal hides and mud. A Whiphid tribe is led by an elder called a Spearmaster, who decides where the group should camp and what prey to hunt. \n\n[P]Whiphid tribes are loose associations of individuals, and they do not have attachments to the tribes of their parents. They are a survival necessity and not an ideological construct or family unit. A tribe stays together as long as it was doing well, and individuals of unsuccessful tribes have no compunction against joining another tribe, nor do tribes have an issue with new members.\n\n[P]The tribes of Toola travel across the planet on sleds and load-bearing sledges that are constructed of hide, horn, bone and leather thong. They are pulled by domesticated Tuggles, carnivorous animals native to Toola possessed of great stamina. Six Tuggles are capable of pulling a sledge all day with only a couple of breaks, if properly fed, for several days at a time. The design of the Whiphid sleds is such that they spread the load over a wide surface area and therefore allow for safe gliding over the icy plains.\n\n[P]Tribes on Toola typically meet at hot springs, where they will trade and cooperate in big hunts. Whiphid tribes do not make war with each other or participate in skirmishes or raids against other tribes. In the mind of the Whiphids, this would reduce the number of hunters capable of hunting motmots and bring bad luck against the aggressive tribe. Individual Whiphids do have disagreements that can last for years and that often resulted in violent confrontations, but these are personal matters that do not involve others. Bullies in Whiphid society are rare, and an elder will take such an individual on a long hunt to sort them out. Those that do not learn the ways of the elder often do not return. Individuals within Whiphid society are not allowed to undermine its functioning.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Toola is a planet located in the Toola system and the cold homeworld of the Whiphids. It is located in the Slice.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Whiphid is the native language of the Whiphid species from Toola. It is formed of snorts, growls and bellowing barks.\n\n[P]There is no written form of Whiphid language. The language's working vocabulary is limited to six thousand words.\n\n[P]Most Whiphids are only fluent in Whiphid, and not in Basic.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Claws : When a Whiphid makes a Brawl check\nto deal damage to an opponent, their attack\ndeals +1 point of damage and has a Crit Rating\nof 3.</p><p>Scent : Whiphids may remove all [SETBACK]\nimposed due to concealment against a target\nthat is within Short Range.</p><p>Insulated Fur : When making skill checks,\nWhiphids may remove one [SETBACK]imposed\ndue to cold environmental conditions.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"WHIPHID"}},"_id":"a9oMvqUtPPqkGV32"}

Their culture is characterized by a deep-seated faith and respect for an individual's destiny. Mirialans undergo ritual tattooing to represent the ways that they have overcome the obstacles that fate placed before them. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Mirialans are physiologically extremely similar to humans. Their most obvious departure from human norms is in their skin tone, which ranges in color from green to a paler yellow-green. Hair color tends toward blacks and browns. while eye color can encompass human tones in addition to yellow, orange, and red. They are generally regarded as capable martial artists, as Mirialans are typically both faster and more agile than humans. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Mirialan culture Is defined by its religious beliefs. Mirialans believe that an individual's destiny is defined by the decisions he makes and the actions he takes. Every decision builds upon those that have gone before to determine each person's ultimate outcome. Because these choices embody an individual's personal integrity, Mirialans choose to express this \nvisually as well. Every significant event in a Mirialan's life is illustrated by a tattoo inscribed upon his face, hands, or other commonly visible location. As Mirialans age, the pattern of tattoos becomes increasingly intricate and detailed. The different geometric patterns and locations of the tattoos form a visual representation of each Mirialan's life story and suggest the role that the individual is likely to play in the planet's future. \n\n[P]Because Mirialans are so open about their personal histories, their society holds an inherent level of stratification. Those who have enjoyed past successes are automatically recognized and lauded for their success, and trusted with greater opportunities. In contrast, an individual who has made poor choices early in life is less likely to receive opportunities for redemption. After all, anyone who meets an individual can immediately recognize the Mirialan's past transgressions. Many who have made poor choices feel constrained to paths that limit them to an unfortunate ultimate outcome. However, for many, their faith in fate can provide the motivation to transform their lives. Some believe that their mistakes serve as learning experiences for later challenges. \n\n[P][B]Homeworid:[b] Mirial is located near the Hydian Way, not far from the Corporate Sector. The world is both dry and cold, which has forced the Mirialans to go to great lengths just to survive its challenges. Prior to the Clone Wars, the Trade Federation used Mirial's need for imports to keep its inhabitants under its sway. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Mirialan is the native tongue of Mirial, though most Mirialans also learn Basic during childhood.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Force and Destiny Core Rulebook[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Discipline":{"mod":"Discipline","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Cool":{"mod":"Cool","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"MIRIALAN"}},"_id":"atcHY4O0Tj9RZIct"}
{"name":"Gamorrean","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/GAMORREAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Gamorrean[h4]\n\nGamorreans are porcine humanoids from the lush jungle Outer Rim planet of Gamorr where their technological level is equivalent to lower technology periods that Human civilizations experienced more than 25,000 years before the battle of Yavin. They also colonized the planet Pzob in the K749 system and were the majority sentient species on Lanthrym in the Elrood sector. Their vessels provide only essential amenities as well as shields and weapons. Gamorreans are typically green-skinned with a large powerful physique, and are known to be fierce warriors prized for their great strength and brutality in combat. They are organized into clans headed by a Council of Matrons. In Gamorrean society female sows perform all the productive work while the male boars concentrate on training for and fighting wars. They speak Gamorrese (also called Gamorrean). One of their favorite weapons is a traditional war axe called an arg'garok that is forged specifically for beings of extraordinary strength and a low center of gravity.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Gamorrean males average about 1.8 meters in height and can weigh more than 100 kilograms. They have thick snouts, close set eyes, tusks and two small horns on their heads. Their average body temperature is 40.56 °C (105 °F) and their verbal tones range from 50 to 13,000 hertz.\n\n[P]Although a typical Gamorrean is squat, green and heavily built not all share these characteristics. Most Gamorreans have a dark greenish coloration over a large portion of their bodies; however skin coloration does vary, particularly among females, with light skinned and two-toned pigmentation not uncommon. Black, brown, pinkish yellow, and even a rare white pigmentation are possible. Boars tend to have less skin variation and have a greater tendency towards dark green skin perhaps because of their higher exposure to the radiation of the Gamorr Star. Eye coloration varies evenly between gold-yellow, blue, black and brown. The Gamorreans generally put no importance on skin or eye coloration although there are some superstitions linked to certain markings.\n\n[P]Not all Gamorreans are heavy and squat. Although this is the most common and generally the desirable appearance in Gamorrean society some individuals are comparatively lean and tall.\n\n[P]They are largely viewed as mindless, intellectually inferior brutes by the wider galactic community. This perception may be partly due to their physiology, which makes it nearly impossible for them to speak Galactic Basic. Their vocal apparatus make it impossible for them to speak clearly in any language other than their native language.\n\n[P]Gamorreans are typically covered by a number of parasitic bloodsuckers native to Gamorr called morrts. They show great affection for the creatures and consider them adorable pets. The number of morrts that a Gamorrean hosts is related to their status within a clan. A clan Warlord or Matron could have up to 20 of these parasites feeding on them.\n\n[P]The Gamorrean diet mainly consists of fungus that grows plentifully on their homeworld. A species of mobile mushrooms called Snoruuk are one of the most widely eaten varieties along with Fug. They drink an alcoholic beverage called Potwa beer.\n\n[P]Newly born Gamorreans are called \"feeders\" until they are weaned. Once weaned the younglings are called \"shoats\" until the age of 3 when they began gender specific training. Gamorrean childhood ends after about 6 years from which point they are considered young adults. When they reach the age of 13 they are considered mature adults and the boars will go to war. Biologically they are capable of living beyond the age of 45 but the violent nature of their existence means that very few boars reached that age.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Gamorreans are organized into clans ruled by a male warlord and his wife, a head sow who is the most powerful of the clan matrons. While the warlord and his boars are solely concerned with preparing and participating in battle with rival clans, the matrons of the clan perform all the productive work including farming, hunting, manufacturing weapons and running businesses.\n\n[P]Females within a clan are all related to each other and can trace their lineage back to a common matriarch. Boars, however, are exchanged between clans at an early age and some will change their allegiance during their adult lives. Clans range in size from a few dozen to over a hundred but typically a clan constitutes about 20 sows, fifty boars and the young. The young are mostly born in the spring (\"slushtime\") and the litters typically range between three and nine. The male to female ratio is about ten-to-one with females only being born about every second litter. Despite this, a high fatality rate among boars, due to their violent lives, result in a predominance of older females. \n\n[P]Clans own and control areas of land and are always interested in acquiring more. Land is gained by either colonizing unclaimed areas or more commonly taking land from rival clans. Since the amount of available arable land on Gamorr is scarce several clans often lay claim to the same piece of land, and they spend their time fighting over possession. A female typically has up to a dozen husbands during their lifetime since a boar's lifespan is limited by his violent lifestyle.\n\n[P]Sows do all the useful work within Gamorrean society and they own and lease all property. They are capable of being as rough as the males and they actively encourage boars to engage in bloody act of violence to demonstrate their virility. Daughters inherit their mother's land evenly and therefore over generations these holdings diminish in size. A matron consolidating land is a critical reason for the ongoing wars between clans. [P]Clan matrons are a select group of sows with the greatest of land who constituted the clan council of matrons. They usually have a number of clan Tusker boars in admiration of their beauty and status. A matron can often be distinguished from a lesser clan sow by the presence of a small number of bodyguards and the relatively large number of morrts that they host. The council of matrons is led by a head sow who is the richest and most powerful of the clan matrons.\n\n[P]Sows are responsible for all trading with non-Gamorreans. They are typically interested in obtaining weapons and food supplies with long lives. They will pay for such goods with gold or other precious metals if they have any or by boar mercenary contract.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Gamorr is the agrarian homeworld of the pig-faced Gamorreans, located in the Opoku system of the Outer Rim.\n\n[P]Its varied terrain ranges from frozen tundra to deep forests, and is considered quite pleasant by off-worlders. Nevertheless, tourism is highly discouraged to Gamorr because of the vicious lifestyle of ferocious, bloody warfare constantly being waged between rival Gamorrean clans.\n\n[P]Prominent mushrooms are also found on Gamorr, as are native coolsap trees.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Gamorrese, or Gamorrean language is the native language of the Gamorrean species from planet Gamorr and colonies like Pzob.\n\n[P]Gamorrese is just a bunch of lexicon, mainly nouns and verbs plus a few adjectives, with a primitive syntax. Although apparently there are no declensions in Gamorrean, it is unclear if the word order provides the meaning of the sentences.\n\n[P]Gamorreans use Gamorrean words as their names, so that the meaning of a Gamorrean name is, more or less, some kind of threat. Other Gamorreans can be intimidated if they hear \"I am Ortugg\", or \"I'm going to Ortugg you\".\n\n[P]Although Gamorrese does not have a sophisticated written language it does have a very basic runic alphabet which is used for record keeping, accounting and genealogy. The runic alphabet is only typically used by educated sows although a fair number of boars can read them slowly. There are known to be several variations of the runic alphabet. Since Gamorreans encountered in the galaxy are mostly males it is generally considered that the Gamorreans have no written language.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Savage Warrior : When making a Brawl or Melee check, Gamorreans add\n            the Vicious 1 quality to their weapons.

Shistavanens also possess large glowing eyes, and can also run at high speed for long periods without getting tired, alternately using two or four legs. As expected for a species of hunters, they have a keen sense of hearing, keen sense of smell, and excellent night vision.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] As a species, the Shistavanens are isolationists. This is evident by the species colonizing all the unpopulated worlds in the Uvena system to prevent them from being settled by non-Shistavanen settlers, their restrictive trade laws (which were unapologetic in how they favored their own kind over off-world traders), and from the fact that they do not mix with non-Shistavanens much. Most of their society uses technology similar to the rest of the galaxy, though some parts of Uvena Prime use slightly less sophisticated technology.\n\n[P]A minority of Shistavanens are more outgoing, and travel the galaxy's hyperlanes. Even these Shistavanens usually remain by themselves or with other Shistavanens. Due to their natural predatory instincts, keen sense of hearing, excellent eyesight and sharp sense of smell, Shistavanens find common employment as scouts, mercenaries and bounty hunters. Many non-Shistavanens react badly to Shistavanens, since their isolationist culture makes them an unfamiliar sight, and their predatory appearance puts many other species on edge.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Uvena Prime, or Uvena I, is the home planet of the Shistavanens in the Uvena system.

Their appearance gives the impression that they are dead rather than alive. They believe strongly in honor and battle and craft small, short-bladed weapons called Tehk'la blades. They live on the planet Nagi, beyond the borders of both the Galactic Republic and the Galactic Empire in the satellite galaxy known as Firefist. Despite their isolation, a number of Nagai ventured into the wider galaxy, with some becoming Jedi Padawans in the days of the Republic.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Nagai are driven by a strong sense of personal honor, tempered by their own individualities.

{"name":"Cosian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/COSIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Cosian[h4]\nSoft-spoken and genial, the reptilian Cosians are seen as harmless or even befuddled by most who encounter them. Their shuffling gait and hunched posture combine with a soft voice and gentle demeanor to create the image of an elderly, even helpless or even senile species-but nothing could be further from the truth. Cosians are shrewd thinkers with sharp minds and keen powers of observation. Those seeking wisdom often turn to a Cosian for advice, which is kindly given-though only when asked for; patience is a central virtue to them, and they often keep their judgments to themselves. When  Cosians do make their way into the larger galaxy, it is often as curious observers and eager students. Their eyes brighten and their step quickens when encountering new beings or exploring unknown places. This can create a paradoxical sense of both childlike wonder and aged wisdom. To Cosians, any beings foolish enough to believe they have learned all the galaxy had to offer are doing themselves a great disservice. Cosians take each day as it comes, ready to appreciate all the subtle originality it has to offer.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Though they walk with a bent posture upon two clawed feet, when Cosians rise to their full height, they typically stand at around 1.8 meters tall due to the long neck that rises from their broad-shouldered back. Scales ranging from dusky gray-green to bright emerald cover their body, often fading with age. Both their head and long tail are crowned with tufts of hair, which can vary in color from midnight blue to silvery white. Their long faces end in a beaked mouth capped with a broad nose. Their large eyes are orange or yellow, ringed in bony ridges; they have the unique trait of blinking with eyelids that rise up from the bottom of their sockets. As they age, many Cosians grow a great beard of long white down from their beaked chin. The Nu-Cosian sub-species does not have the more common beaked mouth and walks in an almost completely hunched manner, but capable of carrying great loads of weight upon its strong back. It is otherwise similar to its more common cousin.\n[P]Longer-lived than most other sentience species of the galaxy, Cosians are capable of reaching up to two hundred years of age. As they age, the color fades from their hair and scales and they begin to move more slowly, thought they are still capable of great speeds in times of need. Because of their reptilian nature, Cosians adapt well to many environments. This makes them eager and hardy travelers capable of enduring extreme temperatures, though the cold does tend to bother them if exposure is prolonged.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Curiosity is of supreme importance to Cosians. They value learning for its own sake, and most are expected to choose an area of focused study early in their lifetime. This love of education is cultivated by Cosian elders, who encourage the young to seek wisdom in the experiences of others. By asking others about their experiences, Cosians gain both a sense of the galaxy at large and a respect for the wisdom of their elders. Older Cosians are held in the highest esteem by their communities, and each village is ruled by a council of the eldest living villagers. These elders are consulted when disputes arise. Although their word is often considered the final say in such matters, most elders encourage young Cosians to resolve their own conflicts through insight, introspection, and patient contemplation.\n[P]Children are equally valued by Cosians for an insight unfettered by experience. A child's unique view on a situation is seen as a gift to all Cosian people, and while elders are respected, it is the young who are cherished. When a clutch of Cosian eggs hatch, the village usually holds a great celebration as new life and wisdom are brought into the world.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The verdant world of Cosia is found in the Deep Core. The only inhabited planet in the system of the same name, Cosia orbits a single star. It plays host to twin moons, Tebu and Tabu, which can be seen clearly in the night sky. The surface of Cosia is filled with massive trees set upon fields of seemingly endless rolling hills. The branches of the cosa tree produces palm leaves over one hundred meters in length.  Cosia teems with wildlife ranging from insects with bright carapaces and wings to vicious predators that stalk the forest floor. Cosians are the only sentient native life. They make their home in villages built  into the side of the great cosa trees, rising high into sky. These homes and halls are connected by winding stairs made finely carved wood and walkways made of etched planks and cultivated vines.\n[P]Each village operates independently, so Cosia has no formal capital. The largest settlement, Nu-Cosa, is home to several thousand Cosians. Technology is integrated seamlessly with each village's natural beauty, providing Cosians with many of the trappings available on most modern planets access the galaxy. However, Cosians have no formal starport of their own. Instead, several small starports and landing strips established by outsiders dot the landscape. The largest rises like a great industrial scar from the woodlands a few miles from Nu-Cosa and hosts the planet's Imperial occupiers.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Cosians speak a trilling, chirping language aptly called Cosian. It mingles with the wild sounds of their homeworld and is often mistaken for the vocalizations of the planet's native avians. Cosians are natural linguists, easily and eagerly learning Basic and other languages. This allows them to communicate with and explore the galaxy more readily. Many Cosians believe that when one understands the vocabulary of another species, one can more easily understand its nature. Many Cosians have a fondness for the language of birds and beasts, learning bird call and animal growls with an uncanny proficiency.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Cosians recognize the Force and rejoice when one of their people is shown to be gifted with it. For a Cosian, the Force offers both an opportunity for deeper understanding of all living beings in the galaxy and a chance for exploration denied to many of their kind. In the days of the Jedi Order, more than a few Cosians rose to the rank of Knight or even Master and were valued as teachers and instructors for their ability to remain open to the infinite nature of the Force. Cosians maintain an open-minded, childlike simplicity even into old age. While this meant many Force-sensitive Cosians were natural Consulars or Mystics, some became fierce Guardians who sought to protect and aid younglings and Padawans.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Strong Backed : Cosians gain +5 to their encumbrance threshold.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 18 - Disciples of Harmony[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Lore":{"mod":"Lore","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"COSIAN"}},"_id":"d9gmWbbvIoWE8Mop"}

Sathari are rarely encountered away from their home planet, for Sathari culture values family above all else. For Sathari, to travel off-planet or even to leave their hometown is seen as abandoning family, so few depart. Sathari are fiercely loyal to their family and friends, but many Sathari are known to harbor significant grudges against their foes.\n[P]Though the Sathari's ancestors were likely once capable of true flight, this ability disappeared millions of years ago. However, their avian heritage is apparent in their plumage, which varies in color and pattern by individual, and in their rapid, precise movements. Of particular note are the facial plumes of the Sathari, which grow outward from near the beak or eye. These long, tufted feathers can extend up to a meter in adult Sathari. The relatively subtle sexual variance of the Sathari species leads to adult males frequently having four such feathers and adult females frequently having two, although various genetic, environmental, cultural, and individual factors mean that plumage, sex, and gender vary across a spectrum and can appear in any grouping.\n[P]Although Sathari average from 1.7 to 2 meters in height, they weigh significantly less than humans of similar size. Sathari skeletons are far less dense than those of most humanoid species, allowing them to move more quickly and dexterously, but leaving them more susceptible to fractures and other damage. Sathari possess four clawed digits, including one that is opposable, on their hands and three clawed toes, one of which is largely vestigial, on their feet.\nLike most species of large fauna that evolved on Arbooine, Sathari have four eyes.\n[P]Sathari speech is by turns measured and raucous. Conversations are often begin restrained, then suddenly burst into lively discussions that sound like chirping chaos to many outsiders. Sathari rhetoric and plans alike tend to be swift and exact. Most Sathari prefer to study a challenge for a long time before implementing an efficient solution rather than working in stops and starts and adapting the plan on the fly.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Glider : A Sathari can fall safely from any height and can glide over small gaps or distances while falling.

They are best known for their natural mathematical ability which make them expert starship builders and astrogators. Other notable features of the Givin are their skeletal appearance, and their ability to survive in a vacuum.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Givin appear to be living humanoid skeletons, because of their hard, pale white \"skin\" and deep sunken black eyes. Though they have four- or five-fingered hands, they have three-toed feet. They carry their arms and legs \"held out\" from their bodies, making their appearance even more bizarre. Some liken their stance to Twi'lek string puppets.\n\n[P]Due to a complex system of moons that create atmospheric tidal upheavals on Yag'Dhul, the Givin evolved a hard exoskeleton that can seal all external orifices to protect against sudden depressurization and temperature changes. It also provides protection from physical harm. Thus, Givin have a phobia of exposed skin, and will avoid seeing it in others whenever possible. In order to maintain this sealed system, Givin need to eat approximately three times more than Humans of the same mass. Givin can easily survive in a total vacuum for a standard day.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Givin are highly intelligent, and have such a propensity for mathematics that their society is ruled over by a mathematical theocracy, or mathematocracy, with the greatest mathematicians serving in the ruling Body Calculus. Their mathematical skills are, like their sealed exoskeletons, adaptations to Yag'Dhul's complex tidal systems—their mathematics were developed to predict Yag'Dhul's randomly shifting oceans and atmosphere. The planetary governor of Yag'Dhul is decided by contests that involved calculations of complex multidimensional differentials, and all political decisions are based on null-modal probability.\n\n[P]They spent as much time designing their starships mathematically as it takes to build them, and so create some of the most impressive, complex, and sleek ships in the galaxy. Often, other species will need to modify a purchased Givin starship, installing a navicomputer or pressurization system which will often be left out as unnecessary by the Givin, who can survive in a vacuum and mentally calculate navigational vectors.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Yag'Dhul is the home world of the Givin and capital of the Givin Domain. Small and barren, Yag'Duhl's three large moons produce tidal forces so extreme that often the planet's water and atmosphere are drawn to different parts of the planet, leaving the rest of the world in vacuum. The planet is at the intersection of the Rimma Trade Route and the Corellian Trade Spine, ensuring a heavy amount of traffic.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Givin language is the native language of the Givin species from planet Yag'Dhul.\n\n[P]Written Givin incorporates hundreds of mathematical symbols, requiring a great deal of calculus to be read.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Sealed Exoskeleton : Given are immune to the effects of vacuum or suffocation.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Education":{"mod":"Education","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GIVIN"}},"_id":"dYfcKmiQJW95Iblc"}

They are expert bargainers, sly at reading other species and using cunning to get what they want. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Twi'leks possess two prehensile tentacles, their tchun-tchin, or lekku, that project from the back of their heads. These \"head-tails\" serve as a second tongue by which they can communicate through signs and gestures. The rainbow of flesh tones found among the Twi'leks are indicators of clan and region of ancestry. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Family is everything in Twi'lek society. The government on Ryloth is an alliance of \"head clans,\" each of which control a small town or larger districts in the city. A family's five most important Twileks lead their respected head-clans, with the power of influence radiating down the bloodline. According to tradition, when one leader of the head clan dies, the four remaining members must take exile in the sun-baked Bright Lands where the vicious lyleks roam. In practice, however, clan leaders find new and cunning ways to subvert exile. \n\n[P]The clan system has stratified Twi'lek society into castes. Twi'leks at the bottom of a bloodline are considered of the low birth caste and used as chattel in the slave trade. Twi'lek leaders exhibit disgust at any accusation of slavery and deny that they would ever put their own people in bondage, shifting the blame to other clans. Nonetheless, nearly every clan engages in \"contracted indenturehood .\"\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Though their home planet of Ryloth is located in the Outer Rim, Twi'leks can be found on many worlds throughout the galaxy, due to their enterprising nature and the effects of slavery. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Ryl is the native tongue of Ryloth, yet there are few Twi'leks who cannot speak Basic fluently. What separates Twi'leks from other species is their second, nonverbal language called Lekku, or \"Twi'leki.\" In everyday conversation, Twi'leks add texture and emphasis to their speech by moving and twitching their head-tails.

Most still live in the rain forest canopies of Iakar as they have for thousands of years. However, the invasive presence of pharmaceutical companies (and, more recently, the Empire) has driven many Iakaru deeper into the jungles, or even offworld. It is possible that Iakaru may become a more common presence throughout the galaxy as more escape the continued despoiling of their homeworld.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Covered in coarse, dark fur with lighter, softer patches around their face and belly, Iakaru are constantly grooming themselves. Long, bushy eyebrows protect their two dark eyes and provide Iakaru with an instinctive sense of a number of environmental factors, including relative movement, wind speed, and even atmospheric pressure. An incredible sure-footed agility, tuned by millennia of gauging death-defying leaps and swings through the dense jungles of Iakar, complements their keen spatial awareness. Their grip is extremely strong, evolved to brochette through the rain forest's branches and vines.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Iakaru organize into tree-clans of fifteen to one hundred members each, led by the eldest females. They usually occupy the top fifty meters of jungle canopy, spending their time in a single home-tree and a few surrounding territory trees. The often-aggressive males occupy outer and lower branches , acting a sentries for females and children in the higher branches and closer to the trunk. Most males remain in the same tree-clan their entire lives, while females often join new clans when they come of age. Iakaru seldom venture to the forest floor, but they do wander to other trees within their territory. Boundary disputes with neighboring tree-clans have led to feudal conflicts, particularly during times of food scarcity.\n[P]In Iakaru culture, everything belongs to the tree-clan, which stores its assets in various cubbyholes along the main trunk. Food is the only exception, and anthropologists often describe Iakaru communal dining as akin to a Corellian bar brawl, except more energetic. Iakaru agriculture focuses on fruit-bearing vines grown above the canopy and insect farming in designated trunks near the home tree.\n[P]Tree-clans near mountains have access to metals and originate most Iakaru technology, which is unique, if obsolete by galactic standards. Iakaru are limited to solar energy, for which they have little storage capacity. Nevertheless, they have developed repulsorlift technology, which they use to expand workspaces along branches and to stretch fruit vines above the canopy during the daytime.\n[P]While early experiences with offworlders have left most Iakaru apprehensive, some of them engage in trade or act as guides, The influx of offworld technology has been a boon to Iakaru society, helping their civilization leap forward in recent decades. However, the coming of the Empire has brought with it mass deforestation, displacement, massacres, and more.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Iakar is lush, green Outer Rim planet not far from the Derilyn system in the Elrood sector. Vast continental rain forests ring Iakar's equatorial latitudes, flanked by oceans and ice caps at the poles. The jungle, dense with kilometer-high trees, is interrupted by the occasional mountain range. The vertical ecosystem here has enabled the Iakaru to dominate their world in the canopy. There, they dine on fruits, seeds, and insects, which they share with a number of avian species. Below the canopy, rodents and insects feed on Iakaru waste while avoiding predatory felines and giant ambush spiders.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Iakaru communicate using a variety of sounds, but most of their complex ideas utilize a rapid stream of chittering and jabbering noises. They bark and screech when arguing over food or being threatened, and they make long, howling calls it they are away from home at night. Iakaru can learn and speak Basic, but their accent is heavy; most teach non-native friends to understand Iakari or suggest that they utilize a protocol droid.\n[P][B]Life under the Empire:[b] After escaping Iakar, most Iakaru fall in with smugglers, mercenaries, or pirates, but some join the growing resistance against the Empire. Their outstanding spatial awareness makes them strong pilots and expert gunners with anything from a sling to a shipboard turret. Those who have abandoned hope for a free Iakar also often find their way to swoop or Podracing circuits.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Brachiation : Iakaru suffer no terrain penalties to movement though jungles or similar environments.

Ecological law\ndictates that the needs of the environment take precedence\nover the needs of groups or individuals.\n[P]Due to this unique outlook, Ishi Tib are suspicious\nof new technologies. Each new device, technology, or\nscientific process introduced to their planet is rigorously\nreviewed according to ecological law, with the\npotential impact to the environment analyzed from\ncountless angles. Without approval, such advances are\nimmediately outlawed.

Most Ewoks have solid-colored fur, though a few sported stripes. Ewoks have large, bright eyes, small humanoid noses, and hands that possessed two fingers and an opposable thumb. Despite their small size, Ewoks are physically strong enough to overpower combat-trained Humans.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The tribal structure of the Ewoks have a Council of Elders ruling over each village, headed by a chief. A medicine man also lives in the Ewok village, a keeper of mystical lore, and a healer to the injured. The warriors of the different tribes wear raggedy garments on the head to signify the Ewok's tribe. The warriors also wear wooden chest shields, the jawbones of tiny animals, and sharp teeth. Some decorate themselves with ornaments such as feathers, necklaces, and pendants, making their body look like a clutter of trinkets.\n\n[P]Prominent members of Ewok tribes carry totems to symbolize their rank. The lead warrior wears a headdress made of feathers called the \"white wings of hope\". The eldest son of the tribal leader's family wears a headdress called the \"red wings of courage\". The second son wears the \"blue wings of strength\".\n\n[P]The Ewoks enjoy singing and playing music during celebrations, festivals, and rituals. Ewoks also believe that music enhances their work. Ewoks are resourceful and tended to make use of everything they can get their hands on, so they use a variety of drums, horns, flutes, and other simple instruments in their music.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Endor, also known as Tana among the Ewok species was the cyan gas giant planet orbited by the forest moon of Endor. The name \"Endor\" was also sometimes used for the forest moon. The planet itself was less well known than the moon.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Ewokese is the language spoken by the Ewoks. Ewoks are able to learn and speak other languages, including Basic. Ewokese is related to other tongues on the Forest Moon of Endor. Many linguists suggest that the language developed from the Yuzzum language, which was taught off-world, and which suggests a possible relationship between the Ewoks and Yuzzums. Most Ewoks understand Yuzzum and have no difficulty communicating with Duloks, suggesting that the Dulok language may be a dialect of Ewokese.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>One Rank in Stealth : Ewoks may begin the game with one rank in Stealth.</p><p>Heightened Smell : Ewoks may remove all [SETBACK]\n            imposed due to concealment against a target\n            that is within Short Range.</p><p>Reduced Silhouette : Ewoks have a Silhouette of 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"EWOK"}},"_id":"fJ6bOSRpRghxFNLl"}
{"_id":"fPFDmwtk1OrpvjbS","name":"Arcona","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/ARCONA.png","data":{"description":"<p>[H4]Arcona[h4] The Arcona are slim-framed reptilian humanoids with clawed hands and feet. They have compound eyes, which are large, green, and luminous. Their hairless, scaleless skin has a wood-like texture, and green, brown, or near-black in color. The Arconan head-shape is distinctive, akin to an inverted triangle, and tapers into the neck, giving them a snakelike appearance. [P]The Arcona rely on ammonia supplements while away from their homeworld of Cona, they have poor eyesight, and their claws developed for digging rather than combat. However, they are hardier than they appear. Cona is a dangerous world, so the Arcona am used to surviving against the odds. Their vigilance and adaptability compensate for any physical weakness. They are strong-willed, effective team players, and always alert for danger. [P]Family is of the utmost importance to the Arcona, and they have a strong sense of community. They often travel in groups, and their wanderlust takes these groups all over the galaxy. A peaceful and composed species, the Arcona are welcome residents on many worlds. Their powers of observation combined with their natural community spirit facilitate social interactions with other species. [P][B]Physiology:[b] The Arcona come from the hot, dry planet of Cona, where the blistering temperatures stretch from pole to pole and remain unchanged throughout the year. While they do survive in cooler climates, they show a preference for a temperature similar to that of their homeworld. [P]The protuberance between an Arcona's eyes is an incredibly sensitive infrared sensory organ, able to detect minute changes in the heat signatures of other beings. The Arcona smell via their tongues, which is why they often expose this slender appendage to the air in a flicking gesture that some other species might find annoying or even insulting. Working in concert, these senses are exact enough to discern moods and emotions in other species. [P]The atmosphere on Cona contains high concentrations of ammonia vapor. Ammonia produces enzymes in the Arconan body that are necessary for their survival. As a result, the Arcona are dependent upon the presence of ammonia, and when traveling offworld must take ammonia supplements. These supplements must be ingested in roughly the same quantities as a human may need vitamin supplements, and an Arconan can survive for long periods without them (though this can have long term health effects). [P][B]Society:[b] The Arcona have a sense of community so strong that they think of themselves in the collective sense. They consider raising a family to be both a duty and a privilege. The Arcona expect each member of society to put the good of his community before his own, and in most cases he does so. On their homeworld, the Arcona live in family-orientated nests, clustered around a Grand Nest where the Nest Leader oversees communal decisions. In families, the males are the primary caregivers, since the females of the species are, by Arconan standards, too flighty and unreliable. [P]Any Arcona who travels alone, for whatever reason, faces a period of adjustment as he adapts to life away from his hive-like community. Fortunately, the Arcona are ready and able to adapt to survive, as they have proven time and again. [P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Arconan homeworld of Cona lies within the Inner Rim. As it orbits a blue star, Teke Ro, Cona is as hot and dry as any desert planet. It is abundant in vegetation that leaches oxygen and ammonia from the surrounding environment, breaking it down to create water. This phenomenon is essential to the survival of the Arcona. The atmosphere of Cona consists of nitrogen, hydrogen, and high levels of ammonia. Most species require a breathing aid to visit the surface, and even then the stink of ammonia is prevalent. [P]Cona is also rich in minerals and metals, which has been a mixed blessing for its inhabitants. These resources attracted prospectors and traders who originally exchanged water for mining rights, but then discovered the Arconan susceptibility to sodium chloride addiction. This compound acts as a hallucinogen to the Arcona, and addiction is ultimately fatal. Unfortunately, traders found it easier and cheaper to transport than water, so they imported it, putting the whole of Arconan society at risk. Swift intervention by the Republic and the Arconan government became necessary to prevent a complete breakdown of society. [P][B]Language:[b] The Arcona are more practical than proud. OffworId, many teach their children Basic first, even before their own language of Arconese. While most adult Arcona speak both fluently, their snake-like tongues add a hissing resonance to their speech. They also struggle sometimes with personal pronouns, using \"we\" rather than \"1.\" This reflects their community-based outlook, rather than grammatical inaccuracy.</p>\n<h4>Abilities</h4>\n<p>Environment : Arcona may remove [SETBACK] imposed due to arid or hot environmental conditions.</p>\n<p>Mood Readers : Arcona add [ADVANTAGE] to any Charm or Negotiation checks they make.</p>\n<p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Far Horizons[h4]</p>","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Vigilance":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1},"Negotiation":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"ARCONA","loaded":false}}}

{"name":"Falleen","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/FALLEEN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Falleen[h4]\n\nBeneath the glamorous reptilian features and serene facade of the mysterious Falleen lies a shrewd mind and cold-blooded precision. A Falleen uses wiles and unique pheromones, intoxicating to most species, to achieve great things and manipulate members of other species with ease. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Falleen are alluring reptilian humanoids with skin of supple scales in tones ranging from deep green to a dull gray-green hue. However, Falleen can temporarily change their skin color at will to shades of orange or red when they exude potent pheromones to attract mates. The scales of their lithe, contoured physiques stiffen along their backs, where sharp ridges run down their spines. Female Falleen exhibit muted skin tones and less-defined spinal ridges compared to males, and their ability to modify their skin pigmentation is less pronounced. \n\n[P]The exotic features of the Falleen make them among the most universally attractive beings in the galaxy, and their grooming and the use of their pheromones only enhance this view. Flowing, silky black hair accentuates their etched cheekbones and chiseled facial features. The males typically wear their hair in a single long topknot or braid, while the females favor setting their flowing locks into elaborate styles adorned with beads and decorative combs. The talons on their fingers and toes remain manicured yet simple. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Falleen species shares its name with its homeworld, which some say is as a tribute to its arrogance. Several feudal kingdoms rule over lower classes of artisans, laborers, slaves, and technicians. The ruling noble houses peacefully conduct business and political negotiations on behalf of their world while administering domestic corporations and private interests. While minor infighting between kingdoms occurs, Falleen nobles choose scheming and political maneuvering as their weapons in place of outright war. \n\n[P]Falleen value careful planning and reason, believing emotion is the natural enemy to a clear and intelligent mind. They consider displays of emotion taboo, and go to great lengths to control any outward emotional indicators. Through intense training and meditation, Falleen learn to rein in their emotions, control the color of their skin, and hone the use of pheromones to enthrall others. Falleen see species unable to control their emotions as inferior, and usually take little interest in their affairs—though many do enjoy the art of other, more expressive species. \n\n[P]While the technology of their civilization allows them to travel to other worlds, most Falleen commoners never leave their planet. The lower social classes work diligently to maintain their planet's self-sufficiency in order to keep from relying on lesser species elsewhere in the galaxy. Instead, the Falleen opt to isolate their society from outside influences. The sale of Falleen slaves to offworlders is one of the rare exceptions to this cultural norm. \n\n[P]As a rite of passage, young Falleen nobles embark on a pilgrimage around the known galaxy to behold its many spectacles and learn how to harness their abilities. When the pilgrims return from their journey, most use what they have learned to better govern the territories they inherit. However, some pilgrims decide to remain offworld to make their mark on the galaxy.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The planet Falleen rests in a pocket of space in the Mid Rim off the Corellian Run called the Doldur sector, and in some small way, Falleen has been a part of the greater galactic community for nearly four thousand years. The expansive rain forests, sprawling plains, and snowy mountains of Falleen remain unmolested over most of the planet thanks to modest urban sectors reserved for industry. Industrial zones like the polluted Yellow District in the capital city of Throne are common within every kingdom. This efficient production allows the population of over 520 million inhabitants to remain self-sufficient. After joining the Republic, the Falleen nobility opened their world to galactic commerce and offered their manufacturing districts to offworld corporations. \n\n[P]Since the Empire's rise to power, Imperial research and development facilities monopolize Falleen's industrial sectors. Eisen Kerioth, Moff of the Doldur sector, distrusts the Falleen due to their ability to manipulate others, and he keeps a watchful eye on the planet. To minimize Falleen influence on the rest of the galaxy, and to monitor the Empire's interests on their world, Kerioth maintains a blockade around the planet. Throne's stellar-class starport, once open to offworld traders importing artwork and exotic fruits, now allows only Imperial traffic and Falleen nobility on pilgrimage. As a result, multiple shadow-ports operate around the planet, exporting staves and smuggling in offworld luxuries. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Almost all Falleen learn to speak Basic to interact with Imperial personnel or traders on their homeworld, to serve offworlders as slaves, or to communicate with other species while on their pilgrimage. However, Falleen believe that, like all other things, the offworlders' language is inferior to their own. The lack of inflection and emphasis in the Falleen language is indicative of their stoic culture and makes it easy for other species to learn.\n\n[P]However, the use of skin coloration and pheromones to replace the absent modulation makes it impossible for non-Falleen, even droid translators, to master the language. The fact that only Falleen can fully grasp the intricacies of their language serves to reinforce the elitist stance that Falleen stand above all other species.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Beguiling Pheromones : Once per check as an incidental, may suffer 2 strain to upgrade ability of Charm, Deception, \n          or Negotiation check against living, sentient being within short range.

The color of the fur denotes the Ortolan's role in society: orange is a political career, green is a military career, red is a domestic job such as a doctor or a keeper of the peace, and blue is an entertainer, such as a musician or an actor.  They are short in stature with big black eyes, a characteristic descended from their nocturnal ancestors that allows them to see well in dim light but can hinder or potentially even hurt them in bright light.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Known for their excellent sense of smell, Ortolans can detect food from great distances. Because food is scarce on their planet they are obsessed with it, which has led them to become renowned chefs and food connoisseurs. They use their fingertips to absorb their food, and also to use various fingered instruments to produce the fine tunes for which Ortolan musicians have become famous. This attribute is complemented by their trunk-like noses, which contain a tympanic organ that also contributes to their hearing.\n\n[P]Their outstanding hearing aids them in their musical endeavors, covering the entire sound range from subsonic to ultrasonic. To outside observers Ortolans may seem mute, but they communicate in the aforementioned extreme ranges of sound frequencies, using their noses and the small mouth located underneath. However, they are also able to communicate in the normal auditory range that can be heard by the majority of sentients.\n\n[P]Ortolans have adapted to the harsh conditions of their homeworld, Orto, with a layer of blubber beneath the surface of their skin, which insulates them against the ice-cold temperatures. This provides energy reserves in time of need and also results in their obese build.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The tradition of dying their fur began when a Devaronian trader tried to sell Ortolans a shipment of food dyes—they considered dyeing their food a waste of time, but found dyed fur to be quite stylish. \n\n[P]Education is the responsibility of their parents, though gifted youngsters would often be traded to other families to get specialized education. At the age of seven, Ortolans are expected to support themselves, and will be forced out of the family unit unless they had a particularly valuable talent. \n\n[P]Ortolan society is reasonably industrialized, though not as technologically advanced as other species. Despite this, their economy is mostly based on barter, with credits primarily used to trade with offworlders. Common names among the Ortolans include: Bedo, Eembek, Miebar, Nabkess, Ooben, Ruznee. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Orto is a desolate planet, found uncomfortable by most humanoids. A majority of the planet is covered in tundra, with a cluster of forests along the equator. It was originally discovered several years after the Great Sith War, though none of the humans on the survey ship attempted to explore in the subzero temperatures. It took a group of Talz adventurers to explore the planet during the Third Galactic Survey, towards the end of the reign of the Old Republic.\n\n[P]The Talz mentioned the planet was unremarkable on the surface, though complex clusters of natives could be found. Deep holes were dug near the equator, and small villages of Ortolans resided on the bottom of these deep holes. The Ortolans are large, pudgy creatures with long trunks, and come in a variety of shades, similar to Twi`leks. Many of Ortolans left their planet with the Talz expedition, a majority of them being entertainers. Quickly establishing themselves, Ortolan entertainers became known as the best of the best\n\n[P]Orto is rarely visited by others, and is known to be a peaceful home to the Ortolan species. It is generally considered to be of little importance on a galactic scale, and the Ortolans are confident that by spreading their music and entertainment, they are making the galaxy a more aesthetic place that hopefully will not cast its eye on their homeplanet.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Ortolan is the native language of the Ortolan species from planet Orto.

Most of them are considered highly attractive by Human, near-Human, and even some non-humanoid standards. They are also known for being extremely gullible.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b]Zeltrons are one of the few near-Human races who have differentiated from the baseline stock enough to be considered a new species of the Human genus, rather than simply a subspecies. They possess two biological traits of note. The first is that they all produce potent pheromones, similar to the Falleen species, which enhance their attractiveness and likability. The second is a limited telepathic ability, used to project emotions onto others, as well as allowing them to read and even feel the emotions of others. Because of their telepathic ability, positive emotions such as happiness, love and pleasure become very important to them, while negative ones such as anger, fear, or depression are shunned.\n\n[P]Another difference between Zeltrons and Humans is the presence of a second liver, which allowed Zeltrons to enjoy a larger number of alcoholic beverages than other humanoids.\n\n[P]It is said that Zeltrons tend to look familiar to other people, even if they have never met them. Most Zeltrons are in excellent physical shape, and their incredible metabolisms allow them to eat even the richest of foods.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Zeltron culture is highly influenced by sexuality and the pursuit of pleasure in general.

Respected\nas members of the pinnacle of warrior cultures, most\nMandalorians receive comprehensive combat training\nduring adolescence. While Mandalorians once united\nto launch great crusades that reshaped galactic borders. they are now fractured and strewn about the\ngalaxy, wielding little power.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Mandalorians are typically humans. though\ntheir practice of adoption allows members of any species to be raised within Mandalorian culture. Despite\ntheir reputation as fearsome warriors with keen tactical minds. there are no significant biological or physiological differences between Mandalorian humans and\nbaseline humans. Oddly enough, there are no recorded\ninstancess of Force sensitivity appearing in Mandalorian\nsociety, though this might be owed to a lack ofJedi testing and Republic record keeping.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Mandalonan society traditionally centered\naround warfare. Throughout history, its members\nfought for both honor and credits which equal\nfervor. Recently, Mandalorian culture has fractured into three separate groups: The New\nMandalorians, The Death Watch, and the Old\nMandalorians.\n[P]The New Mandalorians followed Duchess Satine\nKryze during the Clone Wars, and believed in moving\nMandalorian culture beyond its warrior past. These\npacifist Mandalorians believed in the potential economic power of Mandalore, built around the export\nof Beskar, or Mandalorian Iron. With complete control of the beskar mines, the New Mandalonans, after\nyears or civil war, wrested control of their homeworld\nand steered their people onto a more peaceful path.\nUnfortunately, it was not to last.\n[P]When the New Mandalonans rose from the ashes\nof Mandalore's Civil War, they banished unrepentant\nwarrior-clans to the moon of Concordia. The Death\nWatch is the most infamous group, known for their\nbloodthirsty savagery and desire for conquest. During\nthe Clone Wars, the Death Watch returned to exact their revenge. They were ultimately defeated, but\nmembers remain in hiding on Mandalore and Concordia awaiting the next call to arms.\n[P]The Old Mandalorians also endured exile after the\nCivil War. However, rather than plot revenge on Concordia, many resettled elsewhere in the galaxy. Concord\nDawn, Gargan, Ordo, and Vlemoth Port are but a few of\nthe worlds that support Mandalonan expatriates. Here,\nthe Mandalorians live as they have for millennia, working for the highest bidder. Old Mandalorians are considered honorable and dangerously competent amongst\ntheir deadly trade. They prioritize their family and clan\nabove all else. and train as warriors from a young age.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Mandalore is a planet scarred by years or\ncivil war. While lush forests, lakes, and mountains once\ncovered the planet, it is now predominantly barren\nwasteland. Inhabitants are forced to live in domed cities,\nsuch as Sundari, the capital during the reign of Duchess\nKryze's New Mandalorians. Sundari enclosed one of the\nlargest active beskar mines on Mandalore, making it a\nmajor strategic asset. Presently, the Empire has control\nof Mandalore, where it operates an Imperial Academy.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Mando'a is the traditional language of the\nMandalorians, though most also speak fluent Basic.\nMando'a is especially popular among the Old Mandalorians, who find the language allows a greater degree of\nprecision in speech when discussing combat.

{"name":"Gank","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/GANK.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Gank[h4]\n\nA mysterious species of mercenaries in the employ of the Hutts, the Ganks are among the most feared and bloodthirsty killers in Hutt Space. Clad from head to toe in high-tech battle armor, these faceless thugs and enforcers are rarely seen in the flesh by non-Ganks. The Ganks act as bounty hunters, assassins, and bodyguards for Hutts and others willing to pay the credits for their services and to condone their methods. They established a reputation for unparalleled brutality several thousand years ago during the infamous Gank Massacres, when they wiped out the whole Porporite species to protect Neimoidian ryll-trading interests. Since then, the Ganks have solidified their position as some of the most dangerous guns for hire in the galactic underworld. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Beneath their armor and cybernetics, Ganks are powerfully built, carnivorous bipeds with fur ranging in color from golden yellow to a mix of dark brown to red. Their snarling visages and beady eyes give them a dangerous, predatory appearance. Aggressive and belligerent, Ganks are known to have short tempers and few scruples, though they are strongly protective of their own kind. Cybernetics are such an important element of Gank society that they are virtually a part of their physiology, with every Gank having at least a few different implants or prosthetics. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Militaristic and warlike, Gank society is highly regimented and organized into familial packs, sometimes not so inappropriately referred to as murders. While not readily apparent to outsiders, Ganks conform to a strict hierarchy among themselves, with alphas—often the most experienced, veteran warriors—directing packs of their fellows. Ganks rarely operate independently, instead preferring to coordinate with other Ganks in small groups. Ganks are masters of ambush and squad tactics, functioning with an efficiency and lethality rarely seen outside of elite units. When forced to work with other, less disciplined species, Ganks frequently become frustrated by their disordered approach to combat. \n\n[P]Ganks often take trophies from their foes, a habit that has garnered them the reputation of being thieves as well as killers. Certainly, many Ganks are prone to looting their victims' bodies, to claim tokens that show the quality and number of foes they have slain. Even amongst Ganks who do not lead a life of violent crime, trophy-taking is often a culturally important practice.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The homeworld of the Ganks is unknown. Many suspect that they originally hail from a planet somewhere within the Bootana Hutta itself, or possibly from a world hidden within the dense, radioactive clouds of the Oktos Nebula. Whatever the case may be, most Ganks can be found working for the Hutts within the vertical cities of Nar Shaddaa. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] While Casks have their own language, it is completely unknown to non-Ganks, as it is almost never spoken out loud. Ganks prefer to communicate silently among themselves via their cybernetic comlinks. Most Ganks also speak at least some Basic and are generally fluent in Huttese.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Coercion : Ganks may begin the game with one rank in Coercion.</p><p>Cyborg : Ganks may begin play with up to two cybernetic implants that cost up to 5,000 credits.

{"_id":"iVko1nuEiq8qpnUk","name":"Bith","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/BITH.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Bith[h4]\nCenturies ago, the Bith homeworld, Clak'dor VII, was a strong member of the Galactic Senate. Its citizens traveled widely, debated science and philosophy, and helped their world and the galaxy prosper intellectually and economically.\n[P]Clak'dor VII was divided into city-states. Though chaotic, this method of governance functioned smoothly until the Nozho-Weogar War. The civil war between these city-states was short-lived but devastating. Both launched chemical, biological, and mutagenic weapons that shattered the ecosystem and eventually claimed nearly all of the planetary population. Off-world Bith tried to return, but the Bith governments set up a planetwide quarantine. Unafflicted Bith scattered across the Outer Rim to work and to find aid for their homeworld.\n[P]In the three centuries since, the Bith have suffered the effects of losing a homeworld without actually losing it. The quarantine convinced outsiders that the Bith carried a plague. Since all of the economic support went to repairing their planet, Bith colonies and outposts dissolved or integrated with other communities. Clak'dor VII virtually disappeared from galactic life. Although the planet-bound Bith have stabilized their culture and governments, the planet has remained toxic. A cultural split endures between those on Clak'dor VII and the other Bith, but all use the war as an object lesson on the futility of violence.\n[P]Disillusionment with the Republic led the Bith to side with the Separatists, although not in a military capacity. Not only did they object to the corruption of the Republic (which mirrored their own before their civil war), but the Confederacy of Independent Systems promised much-needed supplies and aid. With the collapse of the Republic, the Bith now face the wrath of the Empire, which uses Separatist worlds as scapegoats for various propaganda purposes.\n[P]Bith have a strong history of adaptation. They survived the loss and slow restoration of their homeworld, and they continue to adjust to life under Imperial rule. As the Galactic Civil War grows, the Bith not only must adapt to the idea of widespread warfare but must decide which side to support.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] With their large eyes, high cranial bone, and lack of a prominent nasal organ, the Bith are one of the more recognizable species. Their large black pupils allow for a wider range of wavelengths, giving them exceptional eyesight. They have olfactory facial folds but don't use them to breathe; instead, the absorb air through their skin. Despite the lack of any obvious aural organs, Bith have sensitive hearing. While tales of Bith heads exploding due to sonic attacks are a popular fiction, they do find loud noises very painful.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Bith pacifism arises less out of cultural tradition than historical exhaustion. After the terrible civil war left their homeworld devastated, pacifism became their watchword. They continued to have a voice in the Galactic Senate, but centuries of begging for aid to repair their homeworld left them convinced of the Republic's corruption and ineffectiveness. Bith are a species both with a home and without.\n[P]The Republic's war with the Seperatists and the subsequent rise of the Rebellion have placed the Bith in an uncomfortable position. Centuries without a stable homeworld have taught them that violence solves nothing, but the Empire's persecution threatens to destroy what culture they have managed to preserve.\n[P]Bith also struggle with the legacy of the civil war in the form of offshoot subspecies such as the Y'bith. The war's resultant mutations killed many, but those who survived stabilized their genetic drifts through bioengineering. Now a distinct and separate subspecies, the Y'bith are similar in appearance to their genetic cousins, with darker and more orange skin and pronounced facial features and fingers. The Y'bith endure a high level of social prejudice from the Bith even though they have the same legal rights.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Clak'dor VII currently exists in ecological collapse as chemical, radioactive, and biological effects from the ancient civil war continue to ravage the environment. The poisoned jungles and swamps are filled with rapidly mutating flora and fauna.\n[P]Bith live in domed cities, the majority of which lie nestled in the crags of Clak'dor VII's mountain ranges. They rely on subterranean engineering and urban-architectural advances to burrow deeper and build higher to alleviate the cramped conditions. While the planet is safe to visit (if one stays within the domed cities), many species, including offworld Bith, find Clak'dor VII harsh and depressing.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Bith language originally had a symbolical and numerical structure, but the modern version of the language has been divorced from the numerology. Some still use the old numerical words in codes or communications with other Bith. Due to their dependence on offworld trade for necessities, all Bith learn Basic at an early age.\n[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b] After seceding from the Republic to join the Seperatists, Clak'dor VII found itself facing a tyrannical Empire whose constant persecution forced the Biths to side with the Rebel Alliance. Still, participation in what some Bith see as terrorist attacks have made many uncomfortable. The destruction of Alderaan reminds the Bith that in any war, there are always unintended casualties.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Sensitive Hearing : Bith add [BO] whenever they make a hearing-based Perception check.</p><p>Sensitive Hearing : When Bith suffer strain due to loud noises, they suffer twice the normal amount of strain.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 18 - Fully Operational[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"BITH","loaded":false}}}
{"name":"Kalleran","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/KALLERAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Kalleran[h4]\nDescended from a scrni-amphibious stock, Kallerans\nare a lesser-known species, native to an isolated world\nin the Outer Rim. Though Kaller was a battleground\nduring the Clone Wars, neither the planet nor its people ever achieved prominence on a galactic scale. This is partly because the species has never been united\nunder a single governing body to pursue expansion\nbeyond Kalfer’s orbit. Further, extraplanetary invaders have occupied parts of Kaller on multiple occasions throughout the last few thousand years, limiting the Kallerans' ability to expand their own culture\nacross the stars as they grappled with the influence\n0f Colonizers. From the Republic of old to the Pykes\nto the Mandalorians, many different powerful groups\nacross history have had a hand in shaping Kaller—\nsome as economic partners and allies, but more as\ncruel oppressors of the regions they controlled. Other\nparts of the planet, especially resource-poor regions,\nhave largely been ignored by colonizers and have\nbeen ruled by Kallerans as far back as history records.\nWhile no single group of outsiders has directly governed a majority of Kaller, many different species and\ncultures with wide galactic influence have a stake in\nthe world’s economic prospects.\n[P]Kaller's location and its natural resources have both made the world an important target for other groups' military and economic expansionism. The system sits at the intersection of three different hyperspace routes. This has made it a convenient layover point for obtaining repairs, transferring cargo, and refueling between legs of an extended journey. Plateau City, Kaller's preeminent and surprisingly cosmopolitan spaceport, was built long ago by foreign interests to handle the sheer volume of freighters visiting the planet. A variety of different rare minerals and the surprisingly resilient hardwood from the kallnut tree remain valuable exports, and the industries around these and other products drive much of the Kalleran economy to this day.\n[P]For this part, local Kalleran governments continue to use the influence of outsiders to their advantage whenever they can, pitting these groups against each other and homegrown rivals. While some Kalleran cultures and governments have feuds with particular groups of settlers, others are far more invested in their conflicts with local groups. However. because of the numerous galactic societies with an interest in Kaller and its resources, Kaller has never been ruled by a single alliance of Kallerans.\n[P]Seeking the stability that they cannot find on their homeworld, many Kallerans have taken to traveling far from the Kaller system, pursuing their fortunes beyond its boundaries. Their independent tendencies and knack for self-sufficiency often serve them well in their tasks as they travel. Some find careers working for others in a variety of fields. Others, however, earn\nreputations as independent contractors, or as masters\nin a broad range of different fields. For these Kallerans,\ntheir starships become their true homes of choice.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Adult Kallerans average over two meters\nin height, standing eye to eye with a Wookiee. They\nare slim for their height, though their physiques tend\nto be flexible rather than spindly. Kalleran feet and\nhands each have three fully prehensile digits, arranged\nin a radial manner. They do not normally wear shoes\npreferring not to restrict their ability to grasp with\ntheir feet. Their green skin often has distinctive black\nmarkings, which vary in pattern by individual.\n[P]Kallerans are not capable of respiration under\nwater, but retain one key holdover of their amphibious ancestry, as they breathe through their skin as\nwell as their lungs. While they do have lungs, a significant portion or their respiration occurs directly\nthrough their skin, freely drawing oxygen from the\natmosphere while releasing carbon dioxide. A consequence of this respiratory system is that Kallerans\nmust consume more water than other species of comparable size, Kallerans do not have noses, as there is\nno need for them to be able to breathe while chewing.\n[P]Kallerans have antennae that move in an animated\nfashion as they carry on conversation. These are often\nused to add emotional emphasis to particular points\nof discussion. The antennae are also sensory organs\nfor the species. These are their primary olfactory\nreceptors, as well as the secondary aural receptors,\nThe fin-like structures located atop and to the sides of\nthe head also augment a Kalleran's sense of hearing,\nproviding extended surfaces to detect sounds.\n[P]Kallerans have a higher muscle density than most\nhumans, but oddly, they are also more susceptible to\nharm. As a Kalleran’s skin is a key breathing organ,\ndamage to the skin can leave a Kalleran substantially\nweakened even if internal organs are unaffected. As a\nresult, Kalleran combat techniques tend to put an even\nhigher premium on avoidance, redirection, and use of\ntheir flexibility to entrap foes than other, similar styles.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Kalleran society places great value on personal achievement, and has much less interest in collectivism than many other cultures. Kaller has no history of acting as a united whole, and many galactic organizations hold some influence on Kaller, so few Kallerans join ideologically driven causes like the Rebellion (or Empire).\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] A temperate and arid world in the Outer Rim, Kaller is the native homeworld of the Kalleran species. Its binary star system has led to a complex system of seasonal weather variation, dependent upon its location in its orbit relative to the two suns. Seemingly mild conditions transition over a period of just a few days into more extreme conditions with little warning to those to those unfamiliar with Kaller's weather.\n[P]Kaller's indigenous communities are located near surface water—typically rivers—for convenient access to fresh water. Their traditional architectural styles are well rounded and depend upon stone construction—now replaced with duracrete in larger cities—to provide protection from the extreme weather conditions. most of their cities are small, with populations of no more than a few hundred thousand.\n[P]The Confederacy of Independent Systems conquered Kaller during the Clone Wars, due to the systems's overall utility. The Grand Army of the Republic freed Kaller during the waning days of the war. In short order, it came under control of th Galactic Empire. However, there is no standing Imperial military presence in the system, and the Empire takes little interest in this world, seeing it as innocuous and inconsequential.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Practically all Kallerans on Kaller speak one of the many local languages that Imperial xenolinguists lump into a small group called \"Kall\". Almost all learn Basic as well, and many learn several other languages of the groups who have settled on Kaller, depending on their native region. Languages developed on Kaller depend upon antennae movements to denote degree of emphasis. This leads to the characteristic antennae movement that Kallerans exhibit when speaking Basic. Because antennae movement is an integral part of all Kall dialects, it is difficult for most other species to master. Further, those movements offer a degree of silent communication between its native speakers. Kallerans who need to speak to one another in silence may do so as long as their antennae are visible to one another, though the vocabulary of a silent discussion is limited. Part of the resilience of these native languages may stem from the fact that many Kallerans have dealt with foreign oppression for generations, and a tongue that outsiders do not know is a useful tool for survival in such an environment.\n[P][B]Life on the Fringe:[b] Having dealt with other species for so long, Kallerans tend to acclimate quickly to new environments and are rarely bothered by the strange mannerisms of other species, but are slow to put their trust in new acquaintances. Their culture's focus on self-reliance means that they are blunt then they feel a potential comrade is dead weight to the group—a trait that does not endear them to many, but also makes them difficult to exploit.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 25 - No Disintegrations[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Streetwise":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"KALLERAN"}},"_id":"jt7xJ6RGCdZ0NN8n"}
{"name":"Geonosian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/GEONOSIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Geonosian[h4]\nNo species has changed the face of the galaxy and the Galactic Republic as much as the Geonosians while receiving so little recognition. Without the oppressed labor of the Geonosian worker caste, the Confederacy of Independent Systems wouldn’t have their massive droid army Yet for all their efforts, the Geonosians, aristocratic and worker caste alike, face occupation and loss of sovereignty under the Republic flag. \n[P][B]Physiology:[b] A winged, insectoid species, Geonosians have a slim, humanoid build. Their chitinous skin ranges from red or orange to green or blue in hue, and their limbs have additional joints compared to most humanoids. Depending on a Geonosian’s caste, their wings may be vestigial or fully functional. Beyond this general form, the height, look, and structure of individual Geonosians varies. Compared to most sentients, Geonosians don't live long-with an average lifespan of sixty-five years-and they mature quickly. \n[P]Geonosian hives welcome physiological differences insofar as they might benefit the hive. By modifying genetics, either through intentional engineering or selective breeding, hives produce a wide variety of near-subspecies among their worker and warrior castes. These modification experiments, however, remain haphazard and prone to the whims of the aristocratic caste. [P][B]Society:[b] Geonosian society centers around their queens, their hives, and the castes within those hives. Offworlders generally don't realize that Geonosians have a queen, and even fewer realize that they have multiple queens, sometimes many within a single hive. In some hives, the queen simply produces offspring, and the aristocratic caste rules. In other hives, the queen acts behind the scenes, manipulating the squabbling aristocrats' desire for power. In still other  hives, the queen rules directly. \n[P]Historically, the hives of Geonosis have fought each other for resources, territory, sport, and political power. When me Geonosians began trading with offworlders, this competition was channeled into economic and industrial—and sometimes open—warfare. The warrior caste bears the brunt of the fighting, though the survivors receive promises of promotion. Often, warriors also serve as police, protecting, but more often suppressing, their own hive. \n[P]With a worker caste whose members function as slaves, Geonosians hives can produce an incredible quantity of industrial goods, even changing their production focus within days. This dependence on an oppressed caste, along with the planet's remote location in the Outer Rim, has kept Geonosis from receiving official representation in the Galactic Republic. Many citizens of the Republic have no idea that their droids and other goods were built via Geonosian worker caste labor. \n[P]Throughout Geonosian history, the worker caste has repeatedly revolted against the oppression of the aristocracy. The warriors inevitably have countered with quick and bloody suppression. When the warriors of a hive revolt, the hive's aristocrats have been known to negotiate with other hives for reinforcements to quell their own populace. \n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Geonosis lies in the Arkanis sector of the Outer Rim, near Tatooine. Its sun's heat and radiation blasts the land, and massive sandstorms scour the harsh desert planet. Large, hollowed-out hive colonies in giant spires dot the landscape and offer respite from the radiation and heat. Tunnels worm through the planet, connecting hives and providing additional space for expansion or waging inter-hive warfare. \n[P]Geonosis has fifteen moons, whose gravitational pull causes the volcanic activity on the planet. It also has a giant ring system, which formed recently enough—in terms of eons—that the Geonosians have myths describing an angry universe destroying a moon to teach a weak species a lesson on survival.\n[P]Because Geonosis lies outside Republic space, the Republic—including the Jedi—had no official standing to investigate the world in the years leading up to the Clone Wars. Even had the Republic been aware of what was transpiring on Geonosis, it had no legal justification for enforcing regulations or otherwise interfering in the massive arms buildup the Geonosians were undertaking at the behest of planets and corporations that would soon secede. \n[P][B]Language:[b] Offworlders know Geonosian Hive-Mind as a spoken language with clicks and low, guttural notes. Offworlders can learn how to speak it, but Geonosians also employ a full range of touches, pheromones, and body motions to communicate. This explains why some Geonosians come away from offworlder conversations with a completely different perception of what has transpired, and it also explains how some Geonosians can communicate as if by telepathy. \n[P]On Geonosis, some members of the aristocratic caste learn to understand and even speak Basic. Regardless of caste, Geonosians who venture out into the galaxy may eventually learn Basic, though they rarely speak it. With this simpler language, Geonosians do not face the same kinds of miscommunications as with their native tongue. \n[P][B]Life under the Republic:[b] While Geonosis was the primary producer of droids for the Separatists' droid army, its loyalty sat firmly with the Confederacy of Independent Systems. For the lower castes, life became more brutal and oppressive. For the upper castes, their wealth and influence only increased. After the Second Battle of Geonosis, however, the planet comes under Republic control and occupation. \n[P]The Republic remains less concerned with governance and more with occupation to keep the planet away from Separatist hands.

{"name":"Devaronian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/DEVAR.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Devaronian[h4]\nKnown for their history as explorers and their striking (and often intimidating) looks, Devaronians are a species familiar to many galactic traveler's. Unlike most other species, Devaronian explorers actually made contact with the greater galaxy long before the Republic officially discovered the other inhabited systems\nnear Devaron. Members of this entrepreneurial species are a common sight in spaceports and other centers of trade, and they are found all across the Outer Rim.\n[P]Devaronians carry the odd burden of resembling the mythological demons of many galactic cultures. Because of this, they are one of the galaxy's most distrusted species. This created numerous misunderstandings during the early days of their species’ expansion, especially as they encountered galactic denizens unaware of life beyond their own world. Though Devaronians are no more prone to diabolical bargains than any other prominent species, their reputation still suffers because of their looks, Anyone who has tread\nthe galaxy extensively (or even visited a cosmopolitan watering hole or two in the Outer Rim) likely knows better than to judge a Devaronian by looks alone, but newcomers are shocked every day when they see a demon of myth ordering a drink in a bar.\n[P] Through their species' collective Space travel experience, Devaronian explorers played a role in mapping the galaxy. While some of this work was done under the authority of the Republic, independent explorers often with strong economic motivations—discovered and classified many worlds. Some Devaronian\norganizations possess maps that are believed to be\nmore detailed and complete than even those in the\nofficial records on Coruscant.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Devaronians are a bipedal mammalian Species. Their skin color ranges from red to green, and a pair of pointed horns dominate the male Devaronian’s head; commonly, females have dark, vestigial Spots in the same location as the male’s horns Devaronians’ mouths are filled with sharp pointed teeth, particularly effective at rending the meat that dominates their diets. Besides these identifying characteristics, Devaronians have a great many physiological similarities to humans—though few observers would\nconfuse the two species.\n[P]Devaronians have black, silver-based blood. This unusual trait is linked to their particularly thorough blood filtration and cleansing system. Members of the species possess two livers, which constantly cleanse the body of toxins and carcinogens. This grants them an\nexceptionally high resistance to poisons, also enabling them to consume foods that are toxic to other species.\n[P]Devaroman physiological quirks cause sulfur to be a particularly effective stimulant (unlike for most other oxygen-breathing species, who find sulfur extremely unpleasant when inhaled). When a Devaronian breaths in sulfur, the substance rapidly enters\nthe bloodstream, granting the Devaroniam a burst of\nprodigious strength and speed. However, sulfur is one\nelement that their livers cannot cleanse as effectively\nover the long term. Extended exposure to sulfur can\nhave serious medical consequences for a Devaronian.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Devaronian culture is primarily matriarchal, in no small part because Devaronian men tend not to stay in one place long enough to achieve leadership positions. Whether these tendencies are purely cultural or have a biological component remains a topic of dispute amongst both Devaronians and offworld\nacademics. Devaronian women, by contrast, tend to value security and prosperity, and have traditionally been the architects of Devaronian society, building and maintaining its cultural institutions and physical structures alike. Thus, most Devaronians who become\ncorporate and political leaders, enter law enforcement, or pursue other careers with strong long-term prospects are women.\n[P]Male Devaronians, for their part, are more likely to be risk-takers, driven by wanderlust and the thrill of new experiences. While not averse to creating lasting emotional bonds, most Devaronian men stay in single place for only a few years before moving on, if they remain that long. male Devaronians who start families often support them while working remotely, taking on positions where they can send their earnings home while still satisfying their desire to explore the galaxy—thus many become starship hands, traders, or even smugglers. Those who remain in one location to raise a family or maintain other relationships tend to change professions more often than female Devaronions, and develop a wider but less expert pool of knowledge and skills as a result.\n[P]Of course individuals and even some cultural groups on Devaron defy these gender stereotypes. No few Devaronian women are starfaring adventurers, and Devarornlan history contains many men who achieved prominence in a single institution or field. Still, some visitors to Devaron are initially surprised at the seemingly low number of male Devaronians in the upper echelons of society on Devaron, as compared to vastly the higher ratio overall among the species’ offworld population.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Devaron is a temperate world in the Colonies region. The planet includes dense jungles and cooler mountainous regions. The species has established prosperous cities in most regions of the planet, though the oldesL and most populous are within the low mountains. Devaron's jungles are home to a range\nof dangerous predators, which continue to thrive on the largely Civilized world. Journeys to these wilds are dangerous for even accomplished explorers.\n[P]Despite Devaron's long history, the jungles of the world remain untamed. However, while some species might see this as a strange choice for a species with the technology to clear the local flora, Devaronians believe that doing so would be shortsighted and foolish. The dominant form of plant life within Devaron's jungles is a particularly hardy vine, which interconnects and grows to form massive tendrils tens of meters in diameter that run for many kilometers.\n[P]These tendrils often reach the uppermost levels of the jungle and even conceal the basic terrain far below. The natural passageways these create make travel through the jungle far easier than it is on worlds with similarly lush biospheres, and while predators are a threat to travelers far from a city or town, there are few creatures on Devaron that cannot be dispatched with a well-placed blaster shot. Further, the biodiversity of the jungles offers Devaronians numerous advantages, economic and otherwise, especially in a galaxy where many worlds have been reshaped into vast, planet-spanning cities. Devaron has a few industrial centers and some large cities, but many Devaronians live in small, tight knit villages and survive by hunting and cultivating crops in the jungle. Thanks to Devaron's long and ongoing involvement in galactic exploration and trade, however, certain technologies are widespread, making survival in the jungle far easier for the current generation than it was for their anvient ancestors, who lacked such equipment.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Nearly all Devaronians are fluent in Basic though some speak localized dialects specific to their culture on Devaron. Relatively few study the ancestral language of Devaronese.\n[P][B]Life on the Fringe:[b] Devaronians have become increasingly prominent in the less civilized portions of the Outer Rim over the last few decades, in part because of the Empire's distrust of aliens of all sorts. The legends associated with their appearance—as well as their natural durability—make them desirable as Hired Guns, particularly among less savory elements of society. Devaronian resourcefulness also suits as the lifestyles of Explorers, Colonists, and Bounty Hunters.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>One Rank in Deception : Devaronian may begin the game with one rank in Deception.</p><p>Resilient Metabolism : Devaronians add automatic [SU] to all Resilience checks.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 100 - Nexus of Power[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Resilience":{"mod":"Resilience","modtype":"Skill Add Success","value":1}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"DEVAR"}},"_id":"kiNwZ9ToMslqwAzd"}
{"name":"Weequay","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/WEEQUAY.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Weequay[h4]\n\n[P]Weequays are harsh creatures from a harsh homeworld. They have thick, toughened skin and a dense, powerful bone structure, and are often seen as ideal bodyguards due to this natural resilience and durability. Their cultural structure, idealizing violence and conflict, also makes them more than likely to follow the path of the Hired Gun or other occupations that emphasize martial prowess over more intellectual pursuits. \n\n[P]Most Weequays tend to be quiet, solitary beings, speaking very little to outsiders. However, this has not stopped some Weequays from rising to prominence as pirates and brigands across the galaxy. There were even a few Weequay Jedi once, and some Weequays fight with the Rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Those who leave their homeworld are generally more gregarious than their fellows, although their personalities tend towards sardonic and biting. \n\n[P]Weequays can communicate nonverbally through a discharge of pheromones from their bodies, but this form of communication is only possible among members of the same clan across relatively short distances. This trait, however, might help to explain why many view Weequays as taciturn even among their own kind. It's also the likely cause of the bitter, caustic scent most species associate with Weequays. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Weequays are humanoids averaging roughly two meters in height. Their desert homeworld results in coarse, hardened skin generally colored in shades of brown to black. Adding to their reputation for grim narrow-mindedness, Weequay faces are rigid and lipless, with a bony frill or crest down either jawline. \n\n[P]Males encountered off their homeworld keep their hair in a single topknot composed of multiple braids, traditionally one for each of their native years spent away from 'home. Less traditional males, however, might not follow this. Weequays' eyes are sunk deeply in the folds and creases of their weathered faces, providing better protection from harsh sunlight. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Weequay society is complex and brutal. Built around the clan unit, Weequay society is pitilessly impersonal, with each individual striving to honor his various gods in his own way. These gods symbolize both natural forces on Sriluur as well as the spirits of important animals. The two most important gods worshiped by Weequays are Am-Shak the thunder god and Quay, the god of Sriluur's brightest moon. Weequays usually honor their gods in ceremonies that focus on the sacrifice of a worthy opponent, either in hunt or in battle. Generally, this is some large or vicious beast. \n\n[P]The recently-ended war with the Houk resulted in more Weequay warriors trained in modern equipment and tactics, and also developing dispositions at odds with their clannish origins. Many of these idle warriors eventually chose to leave their homeworld to seek gainful employment elsewhere, most finding positions in mercenary companies or as blasters-for-hire for a wide range of organizations and individuals. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Weequays are native to the planet Sriluur in the Sriluur system. An inhospitable world primarily composed of arid deserts, terrible volcanoes, and corrosive seas, Sriluur is located just Core-ward of Hutt Space along the Sisar Run. The planet is also home to another sentient species, the Houk, who attempted to colonize the planet over 200 years ago. This resulted in a state of restless antagonism lasting centuries, and has recently erupted into open warfare. This Weequay—Houk war lasted for more than ten years, ending in an uneasy peace just before the Battle of Yavin. \n\n[P]Sriluur has recently been subjected to Imperial occupation for fear of growing criminal activity, Hutt involvement, and civil unrest. A sizable military presence on the planet has not curbed the region's chaotic nature, however, and neither the Weequay nor the Houk are known for their Imperial sympathies. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Weequays on Sriluur speak their own language, Sriluurian, between clans, but within a clan they often use their pheromone-based communication in near-silence. Although only used between members of the same clan, this habit can make the Weequays seem aloof and forbidding. \n\n[P]Some more forward-thinking Weequays are quite verbose, often exhibiting a harsh, sardonic sense of humor in their interactions with both friend and foe alike. These Weequays speak fluent Basic and may often rise to positions of power and authority in a variety of organizations and criminal enterprises.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>One Rank in Resilience : Weequay may begin the game with one rank in Resilience.</p><p>Communicative Pheromones : Weequay can communicate non-verbally with other Weequays up to Short Range.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Dangerous Covenants[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"WEEQUAY"}},"_id":"kr0E3shMNcQaYUwV"}
{"_id":"kyixTtyS7LjBa0v9","name":"Arkanian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/ARKAN.png","data":{"description":"<p>[H4]Arkanian[h4] The Arkanians are a near-Human species which reside primarily on the frozen planet of Arkania in the Perave system of the Colonies region of the galaxy. [P][B]Physiology:[b] Arkanians consider themselves the pinnacle of evolution, and as such many are distinctly arrogant. Arkanian scientists have been experts in genetic manipulation for millennia, and by the time of the Mandalorian Wars the species had been split into many sub-species, making it hard to determine exactly what a baseline Arkanian is. Most could pass for Human, though the most pure of blood had pure white eyes and four clawed digits on each hand. [P]Arkanians are capable of seeing into the infrared spectrum, and their eyes are sensitive to sources of extreme heat. This is helpful on their dark and frigid homeworld, but when traveling offworld, many are forced to wear blinders on planets with hotter, younger suns. It is also not unusual for an Arkanian to enhance themselves with internal and/or external cybernetics. It is also standard practice for Arkanians to undergo genetic manipulation of their own bodies, enhancing themselves so as to be better than lesser species. [P][B]Society:[b] The most defining trait of the Arkanian species is their arrogance which stemmed from their belief that they were the pinnacle of evolution. This leads to them often appearing arrogant and aloof to others as they see themselves as being superior to all other species. Even those with a more moderate viewpoint tended to see themselves as being amongst the most intelligent beings in the galaxy. As such, they are highly confident of their abilities. [P]Visitors to their homeworld often face unpleasant and arrogant Arkanians&mdash;despite this, Arkanians are deeply offended by impoliteness and when this occurs, the offending individual needs to make amends quickly or risk being ostracized. When offended, an Arkanian typically speaks badly of the other party once they are gone and when no apology is given&mdash;the Arkanians are known to lock up the person or detain their starship from leaving the planet with overt threats. Even at this point, however, it is possible to redeem themselves in the eyes of an Arkanian though failure means that they became even more offended and storm away. But, if successful, the individual needs to also offer a gift to the offended Arkanian as a sign of their sincerity. [P]Knowledge and research are highly prized within Arkanian society which means that many of the species are highly skilled scientists as well as academics. Their near boundless arrogance and great wealth as well as dedication is unmatched by others within their scientific community creating research projects that easily match those of the Galactic Empire. Imperial researchers often struggle to match the dedication of the Arkanians as their projects often took generations to unfold. In addition, they are not above using their intelligence and research to gain profit with their corporations massing great wealth due to medical treatments entering the market at opportune moments. Arkanian scientists are well known explorers and they are also famous for their skills in genetic manipulation which results from their fascination in the genetic make-up of other races. This has led to frequent experimentation on alien species, much to the subjects' detriment as a result of Arkanian involvement. [P]The Arkanians themselves are not above genetic experimentation with this avenue of research leading to the creation of the Arkanian Offshoots that are engineered to perform specific tasks. Occasionally, a number of racist pure blood Arkanians were known to conduct purges of the Offshoot population. Reactions to the Offshoots varied as some Arkanians viewed them as little more than tools or even as slaves but many believed that they are an example of the cruel consequences of Arkanian corporate greed. [P]Results of their scientific work has led to great advances in medical techniques throughout the galaxy whilst others are considered some of the greatest atrocities known. They are known to have made significant contributions in the fields of cybernetic medical technology and micro-circuitry. Their actions have, however, led to many races holding a negative view of their kind which resulted from the actions of their scientists. However, many Arkanians are either embarrassed or even horrified at the acts their kind has gone to in the name of science. The more conscientious of their kind tended to be favored as allies of the Jedi Order and the Republic through their darkest hours. [P][B]Homeworld:[b] Arkania is the adopted homeworld of the Arkanian species. It is covered with tundra and rich in diamonds and other precious minerals, which the Arkanians mine to further their offworld connections and master their technology. Arkanian cities are designed to keep the cold out, and are mostly completely enclosed. Off-world visitors rarely have to deal with the frigid conditions of the planet. [P][B]Language:[b] The language of the Arkanian people was developed on their homeworld, Arkania before they made contact with the civilized galaxy and the Galactic Republic. When contact with the greater galaxy was established, young Arkanians were taught Arkanian and Basic, so the majority of the population is bilingual. Among the Arkanian Offshoots, a slightly different dialect gradually emerged, emphasizing words of submission and forgetting those of victory or the desire to challenge.</p>\n<h4>Abilities</h4>\n<p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Disciples of Harmony[h4]</p>\n<p>Dark Vision: When making skill checks, Arkanians remove up to [SETBACK][SETBACK] due to darkness.</p>","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"attr1668999598000":{"modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"mod":"Medicine"},"attr1668999641671":{"modtype":"Skill Remove Setback","value":2,"mod":"*"}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"ARKAN","loaded":false}}}

Making up for this clumsiness are the three enormous claws on each hand. Their supersensitive vision allows them to see the infrared spectrum. At younger ages, their regenerative powers are capable of restoring whole limbs if need be. Their scales range from bright green to orange, and can change in the molting season. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Trandoshans, who call themselves the \"T'doshok\" in Dosh, come from a society that emphasizes strength, skill at hunting, resilience, and self-reliance. Clutches of four eggs are raised by the mother (the father seldom has any involvement); young Trandoshans can walk and possess an instinctual hunting ability almost from birth. By two years of age, their mother takes them on their first hunts, and by ten they are largely self-sufficient. \n\n[P]Trandoshan society revolves around two things: the hunt, and worship of a goddess known as the Scorekeeper. She watches over the Trandoshan people, blessing or punishing them based on the success of their hunts. For each successful hunt and quarry brought to ground, the Trandoshans receive jagannath, \"divine marks,\" that show a Trandoshan's status in society when tallied. As a Trandoshan gains jagannath, he also gains favor with the goddess. When a Trandoshan dies, he bows before the Scorekeeper and presents his jagannath quiver. That final tally of jagannath decides his place in the afterlife. \n\n[P]As Trandoshan society has evolved in the galactic community, the importance of the hunt has merged with other societal pursuits as well. Now, a Trandoshan doctor may \"hunt\" for a cure against a virulent disease threatening his people, or a Trandoshan engineer may \"hunt\" for better starship designs or more potent weaponry. In fact, almost any action that betters the Trandoshan people can be justified as a worthy \"hunt\" in the eyes of Trandoshan culture. Of course, this leaves little room for \"frivolous\" pursuits such as the arts. Homeworld: Most Trandoshans call their home planet Hsskor, though outlanders know it as Trandosha or 'Dosha.

Unfortunately, their planet has been utterly subjugated by the Empire. The Mon Cal are now a species enslaved to serve the Imperial war machine. Those who have escaped this fate are determined to see their planet—and the galaxy—free. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Natural amphibians, Mon Calamari live primarily above their homeworld's oceanic surface on small islands and floating cities. Their height ranges between 1.3 and 1.8 meters, and they have a very fish-like appearance, even as bipeds. This includes mottled salmon skin, large wide-directional eyes (which can move independently), webbed hands and feet, and domed skulls. Other species tend to note they have a not-unpleasant smell of sea and salt. \n\n[P]Mon Calamari hands are intriguing, featuring webs and clawed fingers. As well, there are three holes in their palms suggesting a vestigial suction-cup purpose from long ago. Their feet have similar structures. They are quite capable of sustained underwater living, able to breathe water and descend up to 30 meters without any equipment. Underwater breathing, however, isn't particularly comfortable for a Mon Cal; the species has been adapted to above-water life for too long. When possible, a Mon Calamari uses an engineered symbiont called an organic gill, which he also offers to any non–Mon Cal companions who wish to join him in the water. The organic gill is just one of the many amazing pieces of technology developed by this highly advanced species. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Mon Calamari are one of the most advanced and developed species in the galaxy, despite Imperial propaganda to the contrary. Governed by a highly lawful and egalitarian representative republic system, the vast majority of Mon Cal are altruistic and giving by nature. Hard workers, determined to defend what they believe is right, and committed to aesthetics as much as industrialism, Mon Calamari are difficult not to view as a society worth emulating. \n\n[P]If the species has a glaring flaw, it lies with its members' tendency to be dreamers and romantics at heart. Mon Calamari have a strong tendency to favor underdogs and take on causes considered hopeless or lost by others. Though they value peace and productivity and have no love of war, their communal sense of justice and rightness has often led them to be the first into conflicts in which they did not have to engage. Fortunately, both their immutable resolve once committed to a course of action and their inherent gifts for tactical and strategic thinking serve the Mon Cal well in combat and conflict situations. \n\n[P]Along with a passion for art and culture, the Mon Calamari have plenty of excellent scientists and engineers among their people. Their shipbuilding is considered on par with the best found in the Corellian Sector, though their aesthetic approach to ship design frequently puzzles other engineers. \n\n[P]Under the tyrannical rule of their Imperial masters, the Mon Calamari chafe with a desire to be free, and they continue to build a resistance with the Quarren, their fellow slave race on the planet Dac. It is only a matter of time before they launch a concerted effort to regain their home. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Dac (also referred to as Mon Cala, mostly by offworlders) is primarily an aquatic world, covered by one massive ocean. There are a few small islands and reefs upon which the Mon Calamari have built surface structures, but most of their cities float upon the ocean's surface. They share the planet with the Quarren, with whom they have often warred, and with other sentient races such as the Moappa and the Whaladons (all of whom keep mostly to themselves under the water). In orbit around the planet are the famed Mon Calamari Shipyards. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Both the Mon Cal and the Quarren speak Mon Calamarian as the native tongue of their world, though their long history with the Galactic Republic established Basic as a widespread language on the planet of Dac as well.

Their long, flowing hair is typically a pale shade of white, cream, gold, or even blue. Their long torso and arms are at odds with their relatively short, stumpy legs. Nevertheless, their limbs are think and powerful, ending in massive paws. The hair atop their heads often grows long, sometimes obscuring their dark eyes, and it tends to come in blacking streaks.\n[P]Gigorans have an abridged chin, making their face appear short and wide. Many wear small, rectangular breathing masks to aid in respiration in warmer climates, with chest mounted devices to better adjust to local atmospheres to their respiratory systems.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Despite their imposing nature, Gigorans are gentle and affectionate unless pushed to violence. They live in deep caves in the snowy mountains of Gigor, organized into home-clans of about fifty individuals, each led by its most skilled hunter. Home-clans rarely live close enough to each other to interact. When they do interact, the occasion is often marked with month-long feasts and weddings to promote genetic diversity. Gigorans live a simple existence hunting icetrompers in the mountain valleys and gathering edible berries, mosses, and molds from their home caves. Gigorans are curious to a fault, making them easy marks for unscrupulous offworlders.\n[P]Offworld, Gigorans are interested in everything around them. They are particularly compelled by any shiny bit of technology and can stare at random blinking lights for hours. Pack instinct draws Gigorans toward friendly beings, to whom they offer their strength in exchange for camaraderie. Gigorans quickly accept allies, eventually defending them as if they were family.\n[P]Unfortunately, some exploit this tendency and lure otherwise good-hearted Gigorans down darker paths. Gigorans who have been victimized one time too many may grow jaded, grumpy, and violent. This is especially true of those who were enslaved or faced the Empire's standard persecution of non-humans. Such Gigorans gravitate toward work involving combat, offering their brute strength and love of massive weaponry to any who can afford their services.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Despite the fact that slaves often sold them in the Mytaranor sector as Wookiees, Gigorans are a distinctly separate species from Gigor, a frigid planet in the Outer Rim's Tynquay sector. The snow-covered world is a rocky and mountainous place where only the hardiest specimens of life survive for long. The caves that riddle the mountains are home to Gigorans, jexxel cats, and snow shredder bats. Deep within many caves, hot springs enable edible molds and mushrooms to thrive. The valleys between mountains are filled with hardy shrubs, mosses, and coniferous trees, providing an ecosystem for rodent-like ice scrabblers, giant icetrompers, and even jakobeasts.\n[P][B]Language:[b] A confounding mixture of creaks, groans, grunts, whistles, and chirps make up the Gigorans' native language, which gives most protocol droids fits. However, many Gigorans learn to speak or at least understand Basic if taken off their homeworld.\n[P][B]Life under the Empire:[b] Most Gigorans away from their homeworld live in slavery or on the run. Those with family often find a way to resume their peaceful, simple lifestyle. Vengeance tends to consume those separated from their home-clan, driving them to lives of violence as a mercenaries, resistance fighters, or bounty hunters. Other flail for purpose until they make friends and grow close enough to consider them family. Gigorans who do so are apt to let their adopted family take the lead, often into work as smugglers, entrepreneurs, con artists, or the like.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Adapted to the Cold : Gigorans remove [SE] imposed due to cold or snow-filled conditions.</p><p>Low-Tech : Gigorans upgrade the difficulty of Mechanics checks involving advanced technology once.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 93 - Dawn of Rebellion[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":12,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Brawl":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GIGORAN"}},"_id":"lyw1wsMgCIKSbRtU"}

Hardy and stoic, the five Nikto subspecies are a common sight throughout Hutt Space and the Outer Rim Territories. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Reptilian humanoids with tough, leathery skin and standing roughly the height of an average human, the Niktos are a product of their harsh environment. Bombarded for thousands of years by gamma radiation from a nearby magnetar star known as M'dweshuu, life on Kintan has had to adapt rapidly or face extinction. The frequency of mutation among the Niktos has sped up their evolution, altering their genome thousands of times faster than would otherwise be the case. The Niktos are capable of only very limited facial expression due to their lack of well-developed mimetic musculature, and their eyes are protected by a thin, transparent membrane. Their seemingly blank expressions and unblinking stares often cause others to underestimate their intelligence. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Nikto civilization grew from necessity. Banding together to survive against their homeworld's fearsome, mutated predators—vicious spine dragons, enormous trogwhales, and ferocious tuskbeasts among them—the Niktos learned the value of cooperation as they worked together to tame and conquer their harsh world. Though racial tensions between the various subspecies of Niktos resulted in several bloody, planetwide wars prior to the Treaty of Vontor, the Hutts imposed a unified peace on the Niktos. While there are certain long-standing taboos against interbreeding among the subspecies, children are occasionally born of mixed parentage. Most offspring of such couplings display only the characteristics of one parent or the other; relatively few genuine hybrids are born. \n\n[P]Life for most Niktos is harsh, in spite of the \"beneficence\" of the Hutts, and they toil hard in the service of their callous and cruel masters. Few Niktos are natural leaders, and servitude is simply a way of life—relatively few aspire to anything more than bondage to a Hutt who has fewer sadistic tendencies than a Dark Lord of the Sith. Even so, there is an undercurrent of yearning for freedom among the Niktos that has not been entirely extinguished by millennia of slavery. Occasion-ally a Nikto will escape his master or purchase his freedom, but such an emancipated slave must remain ever-vigilant lest he fall into the clutches of another Hutt. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Niktos evolved on Kintan, a planet in the Si'klaata Cluster. It is a world of varied climates and environments, from vast deserts and dry tundra to forested mountains and tropical archipelagos. The unifying factor on Kintan is M'dweshuu and its radiation, which permeates the whole planet, causing strange mutations among the ecosystems. While the radiation levels are not lethal (at least not immediately), Kintan is still a dangerous, violent world. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Unlike the Klatooinians and Vodrans, the Niktos have not abandoned their own language. Most Niktos are able to speak their native tongue, as well as Huttese. Many Niktos are also able to speak at least some Basic, though the limited articulation of their mouths can make them somewhat difficult to understand.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Lords of Nal Hutta[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"NIKTO"}},"_id":"nzwDMILOfO8XyXHW"}
{"_id":"oZXLwrUle1s36GgV","name":"Anx","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/ANX.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Anx[h4]\nThe reptilian Anx of Gravlex Med loom over most other sentient species, despite their natural hunched posture. Given this, together with their deep, rumbling voices and the color-changing crests atop their heads, there is no mistaking an Anx anywhere in the galaxy.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Anx are native to a high-gravity world; their dense musculature, stooped posture, and heavy balance of their tails all reflect this to even a casual observer. However, the species can often reach four meters in height, despite these restrictions. Their great height allowed the Anx to easily harvest the bounty of their homeworld's chiliox trees when they emerged from their subterranean habitat.\n[P]Because the Anx evolved within the cave systems of their homeworld, their voices have a natural low-frequency echo that, while useful for communicating across vast distances underground, tends to make other species deeply uncomfortable. The Anx in turn are frequently discomforted by how other species have learned to read the color changes of the large crest atop their head as an indicator of their mood, a quirk of their communal lives in their native herd-based social structure.\n[P][B]Society:[b]Anx society began as an extension of their natural herd structure and even modern Anx tend to be fiercely devoted to their families and clans. Their internal clan structure is rooted in a mix of extended family bonds and political alliances, and can be difficult for outsiders to decipher. These complex ties are easily grasped by the Anx themselves, as their society developed its complexities long before encountering other species.\n[P]The Anx developed space travel independently from galactic society. They have had a long and proud history of interstellar exploration and colonization, using both the ancient Gravlex Launchworks and more modern hyperdrive engines. The species is sometimes viewed as excessively curious, but this might also stem from their confidence that they can handle most things the galaxy is capable of throwing at them. Between their massive stature and strength, and a curious ability to intuit the weak spots in the  anatomy of other species, the Anx have historically dealt with every challenge they have faced with relative ease.\n[P]Unfortunately, recent events have finally confronted the Anx with a threat they cannot easily defeat. After the rise of the Empire, Imperial authorities seized the Launchworks in order to study the technology for potential weapons applications. The  Imperials have polluted the planet with the hazardous refuse of their experiments and have placed garrisons without regard to the territorial claims of the Anx clans. Many Anx have begun migrating offworld, fearful of what the Imperials might do to their world next,\n[P]The Anx's reputation for courage and bold action is being tested as the Empire tightens its grip. Anx society lacks the resources to challenge the Empire on its own, especially with Imperial attention already upon its homeworld. It may be that the long legacy of the Anx could become fractured by an exodus from Gravlex Med in coming times, or even that the species' proud traditions disappear entirely. Some Anx have turned to the Rebel Alliance in the hop of reversing their planet's decline, while others look to their ancient practices of colonization as inspiration for a new start among the stars.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The high-gravity world of Gravlex Med, found within the Outer Rim system of the same name, has an extensive cave system throughout its crust—the onetime home of the Anx species. Some Anx still dwell in the caves beneath the surface, although many have moved to cities above ground, such as their capital of Ozlyn Gox.\n[P]The planet's terrain is mountainous, the wide reaches between the ranges housing vast savannahs teeming with chiliox trees and other vegetation. However, contamination from the Imperial occupation of the planet's Launchworks has ravaged the ecological balance of the savannahs, and much of th native flora and fauna have begun to die out.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Even when Anx are speaking Basic, the low rumble of their voice can cause unpleasant sensations deep in the bones of other species. When the native Anx language is spoken—a feat impossible for any other species—outsiders tend to experience intense discomfort, and so the Anx tongue is rarely spoken outside of Gravlex Med. In the right conditions, the Anx can make themselves heard from kilometers away, whether across a network of caves or in the open air of the savannahs.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Force sensitivity is not especially common among the Anx, but neither is it unheard of. In the era of the Republic, Anx were known to have served in the Jedi Order, some rose to be respected Masters. Their grasp of anatomy made Anx Jedi capable as both healers and duelists, while their durable frames and fearless attitudes saw them willing to intervene in dangerous places to put these talents to good use. The prowess of Anx Jedi inspired great respect, verging on awe, when they took to the field in the Clone Wars. Unfortunately, those days have passed. Since the fall of the Jedi, Force-sensititve Anx have learned to be cautious about revealing their talents, especially given the extensive Imperial interest in their species' holdings.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Mood Indicator : If an Anx's head-crest is not covered, the character upgrades the difficulty of Deception checks once.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 18 - Savage Spirits[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":13,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"ANX","loaded":false}}}
{"name":"Squib","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/SQUIB.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Squib[h4]\n\nSquibs are a sentient species from Skor II known for collecting, trading, and haggling. Adult Squibs have humanoid bodies that average a meter in height. They are covered in colorful fur and have pointed snouts, tufted ears, and large eyes. Squibs taste objects by rubbing them over their fur. They are gregarious, insatiably curious, and obsessed with haggling and deal-making. It is said that the easiest way to get information from a Squib is to propose a trade.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Squibs are small, sentient, humanoid mammals with both rodent and canine characteristics. They range from 0.8 to 1.2 meters in height[11] and weigh twenty-two kilograms on average. Their pink skin is covered in fur that range from white, gray, black, and brown to blue, violet, and red. The coat offers some protection from cold weather, but, more importantly, it serve as an olfactory organ, able to pick up scents at a distance and ascertain intrinsic details—such as penetrating through a disguise or identifying a forgery—when rubbed against. The species has both male and female sexes, although non-Squibs often have difficulty determining the sex of a Squib based on his or her appearance alone.\n\n[P]Squib eyes are large in relation to the skull and located on the sides of the head. They come in shades of blue, yellow, red, and brown. Their large ears often sport tufts of fur whose color can differ from that of the main coat; the ears point upward and can pivot to zero in on specific sounds. The short Squib muzzle tapers to a bewhiskered black nose. Their mouths are full of forbidding, sharp, white teeth, and their flexible cheeks are capable of storing items. The species has nimble, five-fingered hands and five toes on each foot. Non-Squibs often consider the small beings humorous or cute in appearance.\n\n[P]The Squibs have quick metabolisms and relatively short life spans. A Squib is considered a child—referred to as a fuzzling—until nine standard years of age. As he or she matures, the fur changes color, a phenomenon that causes a dappled appearance on the back; similarly, the eyes and ears grow more quickly than the rest of the body, causing the latter to flop until the rest of the fuzzling's body grows enough to catch up. Sexual maturity occurs at thirteen standard years. Beginning at around thirty-nine years, a Squib enters middle age, when the fur grays and the face wrinkles. Squib life expectancy is about sixty-five standard years.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Squibs are cheerful, gregarious, and overconfident to the point of egotism. Their biology leads to a common Squib greeting: rubbing a person's palm across the cheek fur. As Squibs often wear gloves, the gesture conveys more information than a simple handshake. They are friendly and non-threatening, making them quite likable—at first. Over time, Squib acquaintances can grow to regard the beings as slightly annoying to downright obnoxious Furbag and furball are derisive terms for Squibs.\n\n[P]Squibs are inherently curious. They handle anything that interested them, usually by rubbing it against their fur with little forethought as to whether doing so might be harmful. Squib curiosity and propensity for haggling make them unabashed pack rats. Although the species has no need for clothing to protect themselves from the elements, they wear clothes and footwear for reasons of appearance and extra storage; typical clothing includes pockets and pouches to stuff with odds and ends that catch their eye, since a Squib can never tell when a particular item might be useful in making a deal. Still, individuals leave fur exposed to facilitate olfaction. Their accumulative drives earn the species a reputation as thieves among some members of the galactic community.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Skor II is a planet in the Squab system and the homeworld of the Squibs. It is located in the Outer Rim Territories just west of the Rimma Trade Route. The world is small, with a varied terrain and climate that provide it with vast natural resources. The planet's system of government, known as the polyanarchy, is headed by a king. One major population center is Metrobig City, site of the Metrobig Interplanetary Blastport.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Squibbian is the native language of the Squib species from Skor II.\n\n[P]Most Squibs know both Squibbian and Basic, although they are only literate in their own language. However, they only manage to get a limited grasp on Basic. As a result, a Squib seems inarticulate when speaking Basic. Their sentences in Squib have surface and deeper meanings, and at least one of these (usually the surface meaning) is lost when translated to Basic, except for another Squib.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Mechanics : Squibs always treat Mechanics as\nbeing a career skill, regardless of their starting\ncareer.</p><p>Reduced Silhouette : Squibs have a Silhouette of 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Negotiation":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SQUIB"}},"_id":"pGlOohrT1Y2dEtnL"}

They are often scholars, devoting their lives to the intense study of a specific field. Many travel the galaxy in pursuit of their research. Academic Bardottans typically only continue a journey after they have uncovered all information in their current location that is relevant to their research. As they study, Bardottans tend to meditate as a key component of the learning process. Often, these meditations include reflections upon history, family, and their cultural interpretation of the Force.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Bardottans are a saurian species, with scaled skin. Their lower legs bend backward, and they walk on three-toed feet. Their forearms are shorter than their lower extremities and end in three fingers and a thumb. Their long necks are heavily wrinkled and can bend in any direction. A beak-like snout dominates their head. Bardottans vary substantially in height at maturity, ranging from just over a meter to more than two meters tall. Their skin tones range from pale gray to yellow, green, and even purple. Some have a consistent tone across their bodies, but others have distinctive markings, including striped and spotted patterns.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Bardottan culture traditionally values knowledge and education very highly, and cultivates an intense devotion to spiritual matters. Bardottan scholars tend toward a high degree of secrecy with the information that they uncover in the course of their research, only sharing details with outsiders when it becomes absolutely necessary. They are proud and independent beings who are reluctant to ask for assistance. Instead, they prefer to resolve issues internally whenever possible. They expect outside intervention only when situations become particularly dire.\n[P]Bardottans deliberately isolate their society into groups within different academic and religious fields. Because they\nconsider all information precious, earning the right to information is a part of their educational and professional process. They become quite loyal to their immediate peers, but they are reluctant to work with those outside of their group.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Bardotta is the homeworld of the Bardottan people. The planet’s government is a monarchy, though the king or queen is assisted by a contingent of Dagoyan Master advisors. Bardotta has isolationist tendencies. Almost all of the planet’s inhabitants are members of the native species.\n[P]After their exposure to the larger galaxy millennia ago, Bardottans colonized other worlds, including Phu. Cultural norms on some colonies vary substantially from the culture native to Bardotta; for instance, Bardottans from other worlds are not always as secretive or isolationist as those from the species’ homeworld.\n[P][B]Languages:[b] All Bardottans are fluent in Basic and many also study the traditional Bardottan language. Those who explore other cultures often master other languages as part of their studies.\nPerception of the Force: The Bardottans have a strong cultural Force tradition, whose skilled practitioners are known as the Dagoyan Masters. This tradition links the Force to the idea of living in harmony with the galaxy. The Dagoyan Masters use the Force as a tool for education and understanding, sometimes integrating its use into negotiations. They are nonviolent, believing that the Force should never be used to injure another living being.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 99 - Nexus of Power[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Lore":{"mod":"Knowledge: Lore","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"BARDOTTAN","loaded":false}}}
{"name":"Defel","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/DEFEL.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Defel[h4]\n\nThe Defel (colloquially known as Wraiths) are barely visible beings native to the Outer Rim planet Af'El who appear to most other species as shadows, re-enforcing the misconception that they are chameleon-like beings or \"living shadows\".\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Defel are from Af'El, a large, high-gravity, seldom-visited world orbiting the ultraviolet supergiant Ka'Dedus. Since Af'El has no ozone layer, ultraviolet light passes freely to the surface, while other light wavelengths are mostly blocked by the heavy gases in the planet's atmosphere. Thus, all lifeforms on Af'El can see in ultraviolet light ranges, but are blinded by all but the dimmest light in other wavelengths. This is why Defels normally wear a visor when they leave Af'El, and expect to be exposed to daylight at their destination. Compared to other species, they can see exceptionally well in the dark.\n\n[P]Defel are short, stocky beings, averaging 1.3 meters tall and nearly as wide. Though they are nearly invisible in normal light, Defel are actually colorful beings. Viewed under ultraviolet light, their fur appear in colors ranging from yellow to blue. Their snouts appear green, with orange, gill-like slits at the base of their jawlines. Elderly Defel lose their ability to absorb light, fading to a dull dark brown under visible light.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Due to the harsh conditions of Af'El, Defel have a society based on communal resource sharing. Co-operation is vital for survival. As a result, the typical Defel is a tough, independent being, with a strong sense of honor. Defel stand by their word, and refuse to associate with anyone who has broken a promise. The Defel live in underground cities to escape Af'El's violent storms. Their subterranean society has developed highly advanced mining and metallurgical technology, though they have not developed space travel or agriculture on their own.\n\n[P]Their homeworld is seldom visited due to the difficulty of escaping its gravity well, making Defel rare outside of the Ka'Dedus system. This rarity, combined with their unusual abilities, mean that much of the galaxy believes they are mythical or supernatural beings. Some of the few Defel who leave their homeworld go in search of adventure, and often employ their natural stealth abilities to become assassins, bodyguards, or thieves. Most Defel who leave Af'El, however, are prized more for their skills in metallurgy, and are contracted by smelting operations and starship manufacturers.\n\n[P]The Defel see some trade in meleenium, a rare substance used in durasteel production, which is only found naturally on Af'El. Vulca Minerals sends one ship a year to the Defel to trade fresh food for meleenium.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Af'El is the homeworld to the Defel, whom dwell in underground cities. It is a high-gravity planet with no ozone layer, and it orbits the ultraviolet supergiant Ka'Dedus. Because of the lack of ozone, ultraviolet light passed freely to the surface, while other light wavelengths are blocked by the heavy gases in the planet's atmosphere. Thus, all animals on Af'El can only see in ultraviolet light ranges. A main export of the planet is the metal meleenium used in durasteel.\n\n[P]Due to the tremendous velocity necessary for a starship to escape Af'El's gravity well, the planet was rarely visited. It was the only known source of naturally occurring meleenium, and as a result, Vulca Minerals made annual trips to the world. A number of private metallurgists and scientists also visited the world to conduct research.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Defel is the official language of Af'El, used by the native Defel species. Defels are not fond of languages other than their own, so most of them do not learn  Galactic Basic Standard unless they have need for it, mainly because they need to leave  Af'El. Ironically, more often than not, it is easy to find a Basic-speaking Defel (other than  the difficult task of finding a Defel at all).<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Light Sensitive : In bright light, without protective goggles,\n            Defel suffer [SETBACK][SETBACK] on all skill checks.</p><p>Shadowed : In darkness, Defel gain [BOOST][BOOST]\n            to Stealth checks.</p><p>Reduced Silhouette : Defel have a Silhouette of 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Vigilance":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"DEFEL"}},"_id":"q8lTop5UuKr9oxKs"}

Callow and opportunistic, these near-humans are scorned by respectable society. Despite perceptions across the galaxy, though, Balosars are quite glib and somehow manage to talk their way into (and out of) situations that are none of their business. It is this talent, combined with their stubborn refusal to surrender when things go badly, that allows them to survive and thrive in a galaxy torn apart by war and corruption.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Tall and gaunt from generations of expo- sure to the pollution that plagues their homeworld, Balosars possess the same features and diversity found among humans across the galaxy, save for a pair of retractable, segmented antennapalps that push through the thick hair atop their head.

Instead, many look for the first opportunity to leave their poisoned homeworld and carve out a niche else- where in the galaxy. Knowing that it is almost impossible for a near-human to achieve success under Palpatine's rule, most seek fortune and glory in the galaxy's criminal underbelly, working for a Hutt kajidic, the Black Sun syndicate, or a similar organization. Even other criminals tend to distrust Balosars, which makes it difficult for them to obtain a respectable position. Instead, many must content themselves with being an errand runner, informant, or peddler of illegal goods.\n[P]Even in these low-level positions, Balosars are quite skilled at gathering information. Some establish themselves as invaluable employees by quietly amassing critical information and revealing it at a key moment. Others secretly sell their information to corporations, competing criminal organizations, or whoever is willing to pay their substantial fee. In spite of Balosars' pride and tenacity, their tendency to quietly betray their employers prevents them from finding positions of respect and authority, regardless of how well- informed or skilled they are.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Balosar is a Core World in ruins from unchecked industry. In its most famous industrial operation, balo mushrooms, found only on Balosar, are refined in towering factories to produce ixetal cilona, a powerful narcotic used in everything from death sticks to interrogation drugs. Though technically subject to Imperial rule, Balosar is in fact controlled by massive corporations, among them BioTech Industries and Fergriss Pharmaceuticals. These corporations continually engage in industrial sabotage and espionage, using the native Balosars as pawns in their greedy machinations. Substantial kickbacks to corrupt officials ensure the Empire ignores these illicit operations. Balosars caught in the webs of corporate corruption refuse to turn to the Empire for aid, fearing draconian reprisals—even orbital bombardment—that would sound the death knell for their already dying world.\n[P]What little land that is not covered in factories and urban sprawl is home to corporate-controlled farms, many of which extend far underground. Each field is under heavy security. Corporations maintain green- houses with intrusion countermeasures that rival those on Coruscant. These include enforcement droids, patrol craft, and large squads of armed guards. The farms, especially those underground, grow the coveted balo mushrooms, which are harvested and then refined into ixetal cilona in the city. It is regular practice for competing corporations to hire teams of deniable assets to rob, sabotage, or even destroy growing fields controlled by an opposing company. Many Balosars are tempted to engage in these quick and dirty operations for the promise of a few fast credits while throwing a spanner into the machinations of one corporation or another.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Balosars speak their own language, also called Balosar. It combines rasping hisses and odd clicks with subtle gestures from their antennapalps. This makes it impossible for non-Balosars to communicate fluently; when outsiders speak the language, it comes off as stilted and crude. Balosars speak Basic and are as capable as humans of learning other languages. They also regularly use their antennapalps to pass simple messages to other Balosars without other species taking notice.\n[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b] Most Balosars join the Rebel Alliance out of a simple desire to survive. Those who can tolerate the idealistic rhetoric of the Alliance find themselves in the unlikely position of being seen as valued assets because of their natural charm. Some Balosars find purpose or even hope among their new allies, discovering a renewed spirit and an unexpected sense of belonging.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Antennapalps : Balosars add automatic [AD][AD] to Vigilance checks they make.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 19 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Streetwise":{"mod":"Streetwise","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Vigilance":{"mod":"Vigilance","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":2}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"BALOSAR","loaded":false}}}

They are also widely sought after as ships engineers and mechanics. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Descended from reptiles, Duros are bipedal humanoids with large red eyes; smooth blue-green skin; long fingers; bald, bulbous heads; and tiny slits below the eyes that provide their olfactory sense. Their young hatch as larvae from eggs laid by the females, but they are raised in a recognizable family unit. Duros aren't particularly brawny, but they possess sharp minds and keen intellects. Both males and females are bald, but other characteristics distinguish the sexes. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Most scholars believe the Duros actually invented the first hyperdrive craft, and their contributions to interstellar navigation are impossible to overstate. They are inquisitive and adventurous, taking great pride in their extensive travels throughout the galaxy. It is considered polite to refer to any Duros by the honorific \"Traveler,\" such is their passion for astrogation and exploration of the galaxy. \n\n[P]With a history of enslavement by beings of great technological prowess and the capacity for terrible destruction in the name of advancing their empire, the Duros developed a profound thirst for knowledge of the very science being used to subdue them. When the time came, they employed all they learned to not only throw off the shackles of their oppressors but to reach out to the stars and never look back. Shortly thereafter, the course of Duros society was charted by a highly regarded monarchy, but as that once-great dynasty fell to corruption, enduring Duros pragmatism led to a corporatocracy that focused on asset management and development. \n\n[P]In the era of the Empire, the Duros have not fared well. Their home—long devastated by unchecked pollution from rampant industrialization—has become an occupied territory, their resources managed by the Imperial bureaucracy. Many Duros have chosen to scatter to the Outer Rim rather than be enslaved by the Emperor's war machine, where there are still those who value the gifts and knowledge they bring. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Duro was once a lush, green world. Due to ecological disasters on an extinction scale, it is now completely uninhabitable without extensive biohazard protections. Hungry to reach out far and wide to the galaxy, the Duros allowed manufacturing, mining, and production to go unchecked and unregulated. The resultant pollutants and hazardous wastes ultimately drove them from their homeworld to live in massive orbital cities and space stations all around the planet. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Using a syllable-driven written component, Durese (also called Durosian) is a well-known and widely spoken language throughout the Corellian Sector and many other Core Worlds. It is one of the foundation languages for the construction of Basic.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Intuitive Navigation : Add [ADVANTAGE] to all Astrogation checks.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Enter the Unknown[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Piloting: Space":{"mod":"Piloting: Space","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Astrogation":{"mod":"Astrogation","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"DUROS"}},"_id":"qLJ206qX2epwrx6G"}
{"name":"Tholothian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/THOLOTHIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Tholothian[h4]\nA near-human species from one of the oldest planets (at least politically) in the Republic, the Tholothians are an unassuming species, once fully integrated into galactic society, but now contained on their homeworld by the Galactic Empire.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Tholothians are a humanoid species with various shades of darker skin tone and a variety of blue and violet eye colors. Instead of hair, they have scales on their heads and several pale tendrils that descend from their backs. In all other aspects, they resemble humans in physiology.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Historically, Tholothian civilization changed and adapted relatively smoothly, especially compared to other species. For example, Tholothian astronomers had predicted the existence of other civilizations centuries before the first outsider hyperdrive exploration ships encountered Tholoth, and the homeworld did not suffer the culture shock that normally comes with initial contact. In fact, Tholothian culture has been remarkably adaptable and fluid, changing with the times with less-than-expected backlash, traditionalist outcry, or nativist anger.\n[P]Once highly egalitarian and cosmopolitan, Tholoth's population was majority but not plurality Tholothian. Over centuries, hundreds of cultures and species traveling through the system to settle in the Slice instead stayed on the planet. Tholothian society has added bits and pieces of these various cultures into their architecture, art, and language (with various loanwords), Linguists can't race historical layers in language, grammar, and even verb tenses. Technologically advanced but not obsessively so, Tholoth's economy has always been slow and steady.\n[P]This Tholothian cultural fusion changed when the Empire took control of their homeworld. Imperial censors removed anything considered foreign (including non-Tholothians) from Tholoth, imposing homogeny onto the language, culture, and art. If the censors could trace the origins of the offending material to a non-Tholothian species, out it went. The Empire then promoted a different kind of unity; for example, Tholoth's cities have slowly taken on the stark, imposing black and white structures of the Empire.\n[P]This in turn has brought on unprecedented cultural shock Tholothians struggle now to understand what should be considered truly Tholothian. As they resist against the Empire, they also resist against this revisionist history, wondering if they should also reject their cosmopolitan past. Some scholars fear that even if Tholoth does throw off the yoke of the Empire, Tholothian identity might be irrevocably altered. Whether or not this doubt and Imperial influence becomes a permanent part of Tholothian society remains to be seen.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Tholoth, located in the Colonies region at the base of the Slice, has a warm, temperate climate. As one of the closest planets in the expansion path of the Slice, Tholoth benefited highly from trade and temporary immigration. The Tholothians established strong restrictions upon development; they welcomed immigrants, of course, but new construction needed to integrate with their ecosystem and infrastructure. Tholoth's cities took on a cosmopolitan character, blending and integrating different architectural styles that somehow still felt Tholothian. As a result, Tholoth has avoided the giant metropolises or ecumenopolises that seem to dominate the Core Worlds.\n[P]Certain areas throughout the planet were designated wildlife preserves, and up until the founding of the Galactic Empire, Tholoth had maintained an arboreal reputation. The heavier industries remained offworld in the surrounding planets of the Tholoth system. Before the Empire, Tholoth was a democracy utilizing a governmental structure similar to the Galactic Republic, with a head executive chair and a legislative senate.\n[P]Due to the homeworld 's position in the galaxy and its axial tilt, for half of the year Tholoth's night sky is dominated by the light of the Deep Core, a bright, brilliant ellipse from horizon to horizon, brighter than most moons. The other half of the year, Tholoth's sky faces the arms and the edge of the galaxy, still brilliant, but muted and dark.\n[P]Currently under heavy Imperial control, Tholoth, at least to its inhabitants, now feels like a prison. Imperial commanders have set up estates here, turning the planet (once a sanctuary to the Jedi) in to a vacation spot. The local population and economy have been retooled to serve Imperial desires to turn the planet into an officers' garden retreat.\n[P][B]Language:[b] During the Galactic Republic era, Tholothians spoke Basic, although different communities on the homeworld were more isolated than others, lending regional accents to their pronunciation. Because of their cosmopolitan nature, Tholothians commonly knew at least one or two additional languages based on need or personal interest. Near the end of the Republic, educators on the homeworld headed a movement to preserve the native Tholothian language group, but upon Imperial control of the planet, this movement went underground. Many fear the Empire's slow, methodical \"Imperialization\" of Tholothian culture will cause the death of the Tholothian language as well.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] As longtime members of the Galactic Republic, Tholothians have had continual contact with the Jedi and the Jedi Order. Jedi who wished to remain in contact with the temple on Coruscant but needed to get away from the people, smog, and skyscrapers would come to Tholoth to meditate. Some would hike and camp out in the various nature preserves, giving them time away from the galaxy without fear of wild, dangerous beasts. The time of year could also be useful for meditation due to the night sky: Jedi were known to come on Core or Spiral Peak nights to meditate on the light and the dark and the Republic and the Outer Rim, focusing on the inner and the outer respectively.\n[P]Since Imperial occupation, Tholoth has gone a little wild. The mountains, forests, hills, trees, and snow-covered regions have become unkempt and feral. While the Empire destroyed the obvious Jedi buildings. claiming the old aesthetic ruined Tholoth's natural beauty, storm troopers missed the smaller, hidden refuges. Small cave systems with a preternatural sense of peace, a one-story stone structure built by a Jedi monk, or the hot spring in the snow-capped mountains all have been grown over by brambles, hidden by rockslides, or buried in ice. Some Tholothians still journey to these locations. A few use them for shelter to hide from the Empire. Each of them holds a tiny bit of history of the old Jedi Order and perhaps preserves something for a searching Force-sensitive.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Cultural Adopters : When making a social skill check to interact with non-Tholothians, Tholothians add automatic [AD] to results.</p><p>Natural Roots : When making a check to heal strain while in a natural or wild setting, Tholothians heal one additional strain.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 20 - Unlimited Power[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Xenology":{"mod":"Xenology","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false},"Charm":{"mod":"Charm","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1},"Coercion":{"mod":"Coercion","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1},"Deception":{"mod":"Deception","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1},"Leadership":{"mod":"Leadership","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1},"Negotiation":{"mod":"Negotiation","modtype":"Skill Add Advantage","value":1}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"THOLOTHIAN"}},"_id":"qSanLtOIaWpMHpku"}

Their pacifist society integrated with the Old Republic early in galactic history, working to maintain peace, stability, and freedom. For millennia, Caamasi were trusted advisors and mediators throughout the Republic, and many served as Jedi Knights. \n\n[P]For all their dutiful service and loyalty, the Caamasi's stubborn refusal to participate in the Republic's militarization during the Clone Wars made them enemies of the new Empire. Shortly after his coronation, Emperor Palpatine secretly arranged for the destruction of the Caamasi homeworld. Although his involvement is not public knowledge, many Caamasi suspect that he could not tolerate the idea of a species loyal to the Old Republic or its ideals operating within the heart of his New Order in the Core Worlds. \n\n[P]Although the Caamasi have suffered greatly since the rise of the Empire, they have refused to yield to oppression. They maintain their old traditions in defiance of their recent trials, including favoring peaceful solutions over lashing out with violence. Not even the loss of their homeworld has broken their spirit or transformed their culture. The unique capability to share certain important memories, or memnii, among members of their species aids them, as the Caamasi elders pass on the teachings of peace more vividly than words could. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Caamasi are unexceptional in size, with a typical male averaging 1.8 meters tall and 80 kilograms in weight. They are more notable for other aspects of their appearance, including a dense coat of gray or brown fur. Their hands are unusually thin, with only three fingers, but Caamasi can grip a blaster or datapad firmly. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of their appearance is a beak-like snout, lined with sharp teeth, creating a far more fearsome impression than the species' pacifist culture would indicate. \n\n[P]Caamasi are also notable for their highly developed sense of smell, and for the odor they emit. Other species have likened it to the sharp, woody scent of Corellian whiskey. The Caamasi do not seem to notice the smell despite their finely tuned noses, perhaps due to over-familiarity. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Few societies value peace more than the Caamasi. They were staunch loyalists to the Republic's ideals, and the Caamasi remained firmly dedicated throughout the Separatist Crisis. However, the Caamasi opposed the Republic's armament for the Clone Wars, including the Senate's adoption of clone troopers, so the Caamasi lobbied for a peaceful end to the conflict. Both their love of the Republic and their condemnation of its war effort led the emergent Empire to label the Caamasi as dissidents, leading to the bombardment of their homeworld and the devas-tation of the species.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The planet Caamas is the second planet in the Cirius system, along the Commenor Run hyperlane in the Core Worlds. Once a temperate world with a highly varied climate and ecosystem, Caamas is now scorched and polluted beyond habitability. Shortly after the rise of the Empire, the planet was bombarded by Star Destroyers on the Emperor's orders. The planetary shields were lowered by infiltrating agents, allowing the orbital firepower to saturate the planet. The little life that survived the assault was devastated by the total collapse of the planet's ecosystem and the firestorms that raged across the planet's surface for years. \n\n[P]The Caamasi species was reduced to a slim fraction of its former numbers, but a new generation has since pulled them from the brink of extinction. Officially, the devastation wrought on Caamas was the result of bombs planted by the Separatists, and too few survivors made it offworld to contradict the Imperial propaganda. However, many Caamasi find the Empire's story too convenient for their liking, especially in the wake of the destruction of Alderaan. The Rebellion is a popular cause for the new generation of Caamasi, who join in the hope that no one else loses a homeworld to the Empire. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Caamasi is the name of both the language and the species that originated on the world of Caamas, and with its bombardment, both are in danger of disappearing from the galaxy. Caamasi make a habit of learning the native languages of other species they encounter, and a Caamasi without fluency in Basic is practically unheard of. Their emphasis on learning the languages of others may have put their own language in danger, but surviving Caamasi elders have begun passing down their native tongue through lessons and the sharing of memnii.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>One Rank in Charm : Caamasi may begin the game with one rank in Charm.</p><p>Memnii : Once per game session, a Caamasi may form a new memnis that encompasses one scene or encounter.

Like most reptiles, Sluissi can use their forked tongues to sense heat.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Sluissi's upper torsos are similar to a human's, with two arms, each with four-fingered hands. Their fourth finger is an opposable digit. Their arms have almost winglike extensions of skin, which aid their movement while they are flat on the ground. The bottom half of their body is similar to a snake's, with a long, heavily muscled, singular tail. Their bodies are covered in fine scales which range in color from light brown to dark green. Other colored scales on Sluissi are not unheard of, however they are quite rare. Sluissi have round black eyes and a swooping, hoodlike fold of tough skin at the back of their heads. They have forked tongues that aid their sense of smell. The average member of the species weighs 60 kilograms.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Sluissi are patient, sociable, relaxed, easy-going beings, famous for remaining calm under pressure. Their patient, calm nature—combined with their seeming inability to have become genuinely upset or angry—often baffles, and sometimes even infuriates other species. Extremely industrious, Sluissi love to tinker with technology and mechanical objects, and Sluissi technicians are able to improve the engine efficiency, power output and system response in even archaic, worn out ships.\n\n[P]The Sluissi are extremely methodical, and work extremely slowly at their work. To them, starship construction is an art form. Although jobs done by Sluissi always take longer than expected, most clients are willing to be patient, because Sluissi technicians can make improvements upon or salvage vessels when no other mechanics can.

Their xenophobic nature makes them ideally suited for professions such as mercenaries or bounty hunters. Normally, they are a very aggressive people, though loyal to one another. The Ubese homeworld is little known to the rest of the galaxy, as they tended to be very secretive, associating only within their own circles.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Ubese are near-Humans who appear graceful but frail. They tend to have fair skin and dark hair, with eye colors of brilliant green or blue. They cannot grow any facial hair. Their facial structure is narrow, with high cheekbones and eyes that appear much too large for their faces when compared to baseline Humans. Males and females of the species both stand roughly the same height – around 1.4 meters and 1.9 meters – with males being slightly heavier of build than females. Their vocal chords cannot produce speech above a rasping whisper sound, so they use a highly refined form of sign language called Ubeninal when communicating with other Ubese.\n\n[P]Few beings know what an Ubese looks like – they rarely, if ever, appear to non-Ubese unless concealed by masks, battle armor, or enviro-suits. Those who have interacted face to face with an Ubese have not recognized them as such, because there are no records in any databases that describe their appearances.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Little is known about Ubese culture. Away from their homeworld, wayward Ubese seem to care little for other societies' laws, customs and mores. They are mysterious wanderers, nomadic warriors who hide their inner secrets and agendas just as they hide their faces behind helmets and breath masks. Although most Ubese understand Basic, they rarely deigned to speak it, preferring to express themselves in their own language.\n\n[P]They seem to be loyal to one another, despite nurturing a profound hatred toward most other members of the galactic community.

{"name":"Selonian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/SELONIAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Selonian[h4]\n\nFor Selonians, nothing is more important than the protection and preservation of their species, and they will go to any lengths to defend their homeworld and their kin. Honorable and forthright to a fault, Selonians appear backwards and gullible to outsiders, but what they lack in cunning they make up for in ferocious determination. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Covered in short, sleek brown or black fur, Selonians are carnivorous, mammalian bipeds with long, slender bodies and elongated heads that bristle with whiskers. Adult females average about two meters tall, making them significantly taller than most humans, with slightly longer arms and legs. Males of the species tend to be smaller and weaker than the females. Selonians have strong tails about a half meter long that they use to counterbalance themselves when walking upright. Though generally bipedal, Selonians can move comfortably on four limbs, and their retractable claws can be used for digging and burrowing, climbing, or defense. Most Selonians are sterile females, with only one fertile female per den, and relatively few males. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Selonian society is governed by a rigid caste system, which is itself a product of their biology. Though a technologically advanced society, there is no central authority on SeIonia. Their culture is organized around dens, which are composed of a single fertile female known as the Queen, a few males, and large number of sterile females. The dens are further divided into septs, the offspring of individual males. The females of the septs tend to serve specific functions within the den based on their genetic lineage, as determined by the Queen. Males in Selonian society have virtually no purpose beyond breeding and are generally dismissed as essentially useless for anything but procreation with the Queen. \n\n[P]Pragmatic, industrious, and sober, Selonians put the necessities and security of their den and their race in general above all else. Individual needs and desires are almost always subsumed to those of the den. Since the actions of an individual can affect the whole den, Selonians put a high value on honesty and fidelity. Duplicity among the members of a den is taboo in the extreme; lying is a crime on a par with murder. While Selonians are aware that most alien species are not as scrupulously honest in their dealings, they have difficulty comprehending deception and they are virtually incapable of outright deceit. \n\n[P]Some Selonians are trained to deal with outsiders, being schooled in language, culture, and expressions intended to put humans and other aliens at ease. To those unfamiliar with Selonian ways, they may appear outgoing and friendly, though most have no interests outside those of their den. Occasionally, a Selonian thus trained may become enamored of alien cultures and decide to travel beyond the Corellian System. These individuals are called Dravas (\"Wanderers\" in the Selonian tongue) and are generally viewed by most Selonians with a mixture of pity and disgust. Yet even these Wanderers put their den and race above all else, and most eventually return home to Selonia. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Selonians are native to the fifth planet of the Corellian System. Selonia is a temperate world abundant in water, with vast oceans covering most of its surface. The myriad small islands and archipelagos that make up the planet's landmass are connected by a sprawling and complex network of tunnels exca-vated by the Selonians beneath their world's oceans, allowing the natives to journey across Selonia without ever setting foot on a vessel.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Selonian language, Mandaba, is difficult for non-Selonians to speak, and virtually impossible for them to speak well. While several models of protocol droids are able to communicate fluently in Mandaba, even they cannot precisely convey every nuance of the language. The Selonian language is almost never heard outside of the Corellian System, but most Selonians who deal with outsiders are at least conversant in Basic.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Sees in Darkness : Selonians see in almost total darkness.

{"name":"Phydolon","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/PHYDOLON.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Phydolon[h4]\nOnly newly introduced to the galactic stage, their world having recently been discovered by galactic explorers, the Phydolons are an enigmatic species whose provincial ways seem quaint and even naive to the more jaded travelers they meet. Yet, the simplicity that many perceive as ignorance belies an ageless wisdom and deep well of spirituality that has now awakened to the wider galaxy.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Phydolons are a paired symbiotic species, composed of the mammalian Agarans and fungal rhizome Orucytes. They are inseparable, as the species have coevolved for millions of years. Fungal tissues exist throughout the entire body of each Phydolon, forming membranes and threads laced through the flesh and organs, even the brain. These threads perform vital functions Within the tissues of the Orucyte's symbiotic partner. The Agaran acts as the \"host\" providing the locomotion for the pair. Beyond that, both beings are in total unison.\n[P]Phydolons are bipedal humanoids with long, gangly limbs, knobbed joints, and hands with an opposable thumb and three long fingers tipped with hard, almost bark-like nails. Their heads are broad and sloping, and their eyes are large, lidless orbs with a central pupil, white iris, and dark-colored sclera veined through with white fungal threads. The average Phydolon stands roughly two meters tall and weighs significantly less than a human of comparable height.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Little is known about either species prior to their coevolution, but a few details can be surmised. Many a galactic biologist has theorized that without the unique symbiosis of the Agarans and Orucytes, neither species would have ever achieved self-awareness. Spores similar to those of the Orucytes are found throughout the soil and lowland atmosphere of Mydasos, though in no other example have they reached the genetic complexity of their sapient kin. Likewise, mammalian predecessor-species exist across the continents of Mydasos, yet the Agarans are the only mammals that have achieved sentience, spiritual enlightenment, and culture.\n[P]Both the Agarans and the Orucytes have their own consciousness, but due to the neural integration of the fungal threads within the brain tissue, a Phydolon's mind is both a pair of individuals and a blended whole. In this way, a single Phydolon is both two minds and one. Indeed, due to the rhizomatic nature of the Orucytes, Phydolons share a limited sort of intra species gestalt consciousness. The fungal rhizome is millions of years old, and through it, Phydolons are born with a legacy of genetic memory. Individuals are not part of a hive mind, nor do they share the thoughts. opinions, or knowledge of either their contemporaries or ancestors. Instead, the gestalt consciousness manifests as a heightened instinct, a powerful sense of belonging and community, and a feeling of being part of something greater than themselves.\n[P]Such a mindset is fertile ground for a deeply spiritual society. Given their relative isolation from the wider galaxy and penchant for contemplation, the Phydolons live a highly communal, nearly monastic life. In close-knit communities spread across Mydasos, each individual acts and provides according to that being's capability and personal drives, yet all is done with an underlying concern for the whole, without the need for structured government or enforced social order. The Phydolons are led by wise and charismatic leaders who rise to power not through any formal election or ordainment, but by the gestalt will of the community.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Mydasos, the homeworld of the Phydolons and the only planet to boast a native population of the species, is a nearly undiscovered backwater world between the Corellian Trade Spine and the Hydian Way, nestled comfortably in the largely unexplored Dalicron sector. The only life-bearing planet orbiting its star, Mydasos went utterly unnoticed by interstellar exploration until relatively recently. What the first explorers found was a world teeming with life, a primordial landscape midway through the slow evolutionary march from boggy marshland to continent-spanning forest. Dozens of small, shallow seas dot the globe, the majority of the planet's liquid water saturating the soil of the largely unbroken landmasses. Craggy mountains erupt from the dense primeval forests, their roots resting in the shallow swamps.\n[P]Both flora and fauna thrive on Mydasos. Its land and shallow oceans are home to a staggering number of species, given the limited number of distinct climates and biomes that stretch around the planet's equatorial and temperate zones.\n[P]The enclaves of the Phydolons are scattered across the surface of Mydasos, and their structure and architecture take two primary forms. In the lowland marshes, towering trees are connected by wooden platforms and pathways suspended just above the wet ground. Hide canopies are hung from wooden poles to provide shelter from the elements, but walls and doors are all but unheard of. Privacy is a concept foreign to the Phydolons. In the mountainous highlands, cliffsides serve as the foundations for similar platforms and pathways, hung by long, root-tendril ropes anchored to the raw stone. In those chilly heights, walls and enclosures are more common, to protect against the buffeting winds and frequent storms.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Of course, all sentient life forms eventually develop the capacity to communicate among themselves, and the Phydolons are no different, though many offworlders consider their natural language to be primitive and underdeveloped. Few outside the ranks of learned xenoanthropologists realize that when Phydolons are in close proximity, they are able to directly convey emotional meaning more accurately than most sentient species. It is for this reason that the Phydolons' verbal language need not possess the complexity others do. Among the Phydolons, a few simple words and a wave of empathetic context is as complex and evocative as any exchange in Basic. Unfortunately, this transmitted empathy does not extend to sentients outside their species, who lack any connection to the Orucytes' rhizome. PhydoIons are, however, able to learn and speak other species' languages, though they find them needlessly complex.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Due to the unique nature of their symbiotic society, the Phydoions find the notion of the Living Force familiar and welcome. Their existence is fundamentally defined by interconnectivity with others, much as the Force flows through and connects all things. In the ages prior to their discovery by galactic explorers, those PhydoIons who possessed a sensitivity to the Force were known as visionaries whose consciousness extended beyond their enclave, beyond even their homeworld. As such, most Force-sensitive Phydolons see the Force as something that binds the universe together, not something to be exploited for personal gain or power.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Cool : Phydolons may begin the game with one rank in Cool.</p><p>Symbiotic Resilience : When recovering wounds naturally, Phylodons heal 1 extra wound per full night's rest.

{"name":"Melitto","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/MELITTO.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Melitto[h4]\nMelittos are insectile, chitin-plated bipeds who hail from the volcanic Inner Rim planet of Li-Toran. Lacking eyes, they rely on auditory organs and feathery cilia to sense their surroundings. The cilia cover their bodies, allowing them to detect vibrations, scents, and even electrical fields. Through powerful scent-memories, Melittos can identify and track specific targets and penetrate clever disguises. They can even sense the chemical compounds that identify diseases, making them gifted natural physicians. Many Melittos use their abilities to become renowned bounty hunters or trackers. \n[P]Nearly all Melittos live in densely packed underground hives, although a few exist outside of hive society. Most of the latter, known as ronin, leave their homeworld to travel the galaxy. Some of them find new purpose in contributing to the Alliance via their rare abilities. \n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Melittos are cold-blooded, preferring hot climates whenever possible. Newborns lack the species' distinctive chitin scales, which grow as they mature, making it possible to judge age by the number, size, and condition of the plates. Melittos' cilia also grow with age, beginning as brightly hued strands and becoming less colorful over the years. Chitin and cilia coloration indicates a Melitto's hive of origin, though the sightless Melittos rely on individual scent-memories for this information.\n[P]Melittos can only digest sugary liquids. Their diet consists primarily of the crimson sap from a native coral-like organism known as bleeding rock, which grows in the thick steam within Li-Toran's underground tunnels. The air in the tunnels contains much higher densities of toxic compounds than the world's already dangerous surface atmosphere. As the Melittos evolved in this harsh environment, their very survival depends on these toxins. When offworld, they must wear a special survival device that lets them breathe the same compounds; the device also distills local foodstuffs into sweet-smelling liquids that simulate bleeding-rock sap.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Melittos live in caste-based hives, each controlled by a single queen, who is supported by younger females known as myrmitrices. Queens and myrmitrices emit special pheromones that control the males, who are called myrmites. The myrmites make up the majority of the population and perform almost all hive activities, including combat, maintenance, and, most importantly, agriculture.\n[P]Hive society is built around tending bleeding-rock coral farms and harvesting the highly nutritious red sap the coral produces. This is a difficult process, and poor harvests can rapidly lead to population pressures. Thus, when a hive becomes too large to operate given its food supply, groups of myrmitrices and their myrmite followers soon leave, either voluntarily or forcibly. The exiles create a new hive in another underground region, and soon the myrmitrices vie to become its new queen in a deadly struggle. The victorious myrmitrix and her myrmites take control of the new hive. Surviving myrmites belonging to defeated myrmitrices become hiveless ronin, most of whom leave Li-Toran for new lives. Some seek out organizations on other worlds to act as surrogate hives for them, while others strike out on their own and become independent agents.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Li-Toran is a harsh world of violent storms. The intense volcanic activity creates dark, noxious clouds that let almost no light pierce through to the ground. These factors have made the planet extremely hot and unpleasant to outsiders. Rivers of molten rock carve complex networks of constantly shifting tunnels through the crust, where most of the native flora and fauna evolved. Many of the tunnels expand into huge caverns, some kilometers in size, where Melittos make their hives.\n[P]On the surface, the Empire has a garrison named Dometown to monitor the population. The posting has become somewhat of a punishment detail due to the dangerous conditions; stormtroopers here sometimes refer to it as Doomtown. Traveling elsewhere on the planet (or rather, below its surface) demands heavy environmental suits for even short durations.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Melittos communicate primarily through pheromones; even their written language is composed of scents rather than letters. This makes it hard for outsiders to communicate with them. To mitigate this issue, the Melittos' survival device includes a vocoder to translate their pheromones into Basic and others' Basic into their scent-language.\n[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b] The major hives of Li-Toran are highly isolationist; citizens care little for the barely comprehensible politics of the Empire or Alliance. Li-Toran itself has few valuable resources of interest to the Empire. However, the Empire conscripts ronin from across the galaxy into forced labor in harsh environments and toxic factories where the conditions would be fatal to others. Such practices have led to a growing hatred for the Empire among the ronin.\n[P]Melitto ronin have much to offer the Alliance: their combat skills make them excellent Soldiers, and their unique senses make them particularly well-suited for the Spy careen Their innate medical skills facilitate work as field Medics as well, Though many ronin find themselves confused by the social interactions of other species, the tactical abilities many develop in hive warfare can also make them skilled Commanders.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Sightless Vision : Melittos can perceive their surroundings without needing light, and they never suffer penalties on combat or Perception checks due to darkness or other environmental factors that affect vision.</p><p>Reliant on Toxins : Melittos require the toxins of their native atmosphere to live; offworld, they gain free special respirators to emulate the conditions of their homeworld. They treat standard planetary air composition as a corrosive atmosphere with rating 6.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 21 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"MELITTO"}},"_id":"rmZrsYVMA9baJWSK"}
{"name":"Drall","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/DRALL.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Drall[h4]\n\nThe Drall are renowned throughout the galaxy as thinkers. A race of scholars and scientists, relatively few Drell ever journey beyond the bounds of the Corellian System, preferring to pursue sensible, quiet lives of study and reflection. Those Drall who undertake a life of perilous travel and adventure in the wider galaxy are rare indeed. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Averaging about one meter tall, with females being slightly taller, the Drall are covered in fur ranging from a ruddy brown to shades of grey and black. Drell have short snouts and small, almond-shaped black eyes which are sensitive to bright light. Their limbs are relatively short, giving them a somewhat dwarfish appearance, with well-articulated four-fingered hands and back-bent legs ending in slender, clawed feet. Drall mature quickly relative to humans, and tend to live for about one hundred galactic standard years. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Practical, dignified, and highly intelligent, the Drall tend to be very level-headed and unflappable, with a penchant for order and stability. Analytical and meticulous by their nature, the Drell excel at scientific investigation and research, record-keeping, and other scholarly pursuits. Throughout history, the Drall have produced countless brilliant scientists and engineers, and Drall theories undoubtedly helped lead to the development of hyperspace travel. There is little that does not interest them to some extent, yet for all their genius, Drall prefer to tackle problems in the abstract rather than implement their ideas to practical ends. As a result, the Drall rarely innovate new technologies, but instead adapt the tools of other species. \n\n[P]Drall society is ordered around extended family clans headed by a matriarch known as a Duchess. Rather than a hereditary or elected position, Duchesses are chosen by their predecessors or a council of elders based on merit, and they retain their title for life or until they choose to step down and appoint a successor. Once appointed, a Duchess owns all of her clan's property and goods, and she governs the clan as a sort of benevolent dictator, often taking direct interest in the lives of her individual subjects. Though no Duchess holds absolute sway over their homeworld, most clans tend to follow the general direction set by the Duchess of the most prosperous and influential clan (which can vary as clans' fortunes rise and fall). \n\n[P]Among the Drall, gossip is practically an art form, and a Drall will talk for hours about the latest news regarding his extended family or rumors about other clans. This tendency towards gregariousness can wear on other species, especially when a Drall begins to recount every trivial event regarding themselves and their families. While few Drall ever venture beyond the Corellian System—something frowned up0n by most clans as aberrant and overly-adventurous behavior—Drall elsewhere in the galaxy are often employed by megacorporations, such as Athakam MedTech, Chiewab Amalgamated Pharmaceuticals, or TaggeCo, as researchers and pharmaceutical consultants. A few even earn their credits as information brokers or through criminal associations. \n\n[P][B]Homeworid:[b] A relatively temperate world of rolling grasslands and forests, the Drall homeworld is the second planet from Corell. Dotted with several large, land-locked seas—the most famous of which is the Boiling Sea—Drall remains sparsely populated and largely rural, with only a few small urban regions and scattered townships. The climate is uncomfortably warm during the summer, only cooled by mild winter precipitation.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Drall speak Drallish. As might be expected of a species obsessed with knowledge and record-keeping, Drallish is a very precise language with an enormous vocabulary and different words to describe subtle variations of the same thing or concept. Truly mastering the language is difficult for native speakers, and most non-Drall are lucky to be at best conversant.

{"name":"Neimoidian","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/NEIM.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Neimoidian[h4]\n\nThe Neimoidian species is an offshoot of the Duros, diverging physiologically and culturally after long isolation on the world of Neimoidia. Despite their shared ancestry with the ancient spacer culture of the Duros, Neimoidians have little in common with their adventurous cousins. Instead, their ruthless mercantile and colonial efforts earned them a reputation as conniving schemers, which was further cemented by the actions of the Trade Federation during the Clone Wars. \n\n[P]After years of Neimoidian-backed Separatists waging war on the Republic, the species has an overwhelmingly negative reputation for being cruel, cowardly, and weak-willed. Recently, Neimoidians have attempted to associate themselves with the Duros to redeem themselves in the eyes of the galaxy, but the Duros oppose the scheme at every opportunity. The Neimoidians might likely remain under the shadow of the Clone Wars until they can work alongside the Rebellion to put them right. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Neimoidians closely resemble their Duros cousins. Both species are smooth-skinned, hairless humanoids with large red eyes and blue-green skin, and both species hatch from eggs in a larval \"grub\" stage. A closer look reveals more gray tones in Neimoidian skin. Additionally, Neimoidians' pupils split horizontally, and their distinct skeletal structure creates protrusions on their foreheads. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] In the past, Neimoidian upbringing focused on competitive education, starting from the earliest period of youth. Young Neimoidians were typically raised by the government of their homeworld or another Neimoidian colony worlds. This instilled future leaders with the fierce competitive instinct they were thought to need. Food and other essentials were distributed in a communal pool for the young Neimoidians, and there was no oversight to prevent a few greedy individuals from taking all they desired, leaving little to nothing for others. \n\n[P]The Empire's seizure of most Neimoidian assets after the Clone Wars and the destruction of many grub-hatcheries in battles of that period led some Neimoidian worlds to reconsider their society, shifting away from selfishness and rampant indulgence and toward a more modest and evenly structured system. Skeptics across the galaxy claim this is only because Neimoidians no longer have the resources to support their old lifestyles, but the fact remains that a new generation of Neimoidians was brought up with values different from their forebears. What they do with this new education remains to be seen.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The ancient Duros colony world of Neimoidia is far from an ideal habitat. It has a dim sun and high gravity, as well as dismal fogs throughout most of the year. Despite these disadvantages, the colonists eventually developed it into a thriving center of industry and expanded outward to a number of nearby worlds. These secondary colonies—known as the Neimoidian purse worlds—hold as much cultural significance for the species as Neimoidia itself. The most prominent purse worlds are Cato Neimoidia, Deko Neimoidia, and Koru Neimoidia, all of which were eventually developed to the point of becoming more desirable and hospitable destinations than the Neimoidian homeworld. \n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Neimoidian language—known as Pak Pak—is commonly used among Neimoidians, but species who lack the throat structure of its native speakers cannot easily replicate the distinctive sharp croaks. Therefore, Neimoidians who spend time among other species learn to speak Basic. Neimoidians have little difficulty with Basic, though like many species with unique vocal structures, some speak it with a thick accent.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Negotiation : Neimoidians may begin the game with one free rank in Negotiation.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Desperate Allies[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"NEIM"}},"_id":"vPL9LukRnhgLT2nR"}

While this stereotype is not particularly fair, it has proven difficult for the Dugs to shek, in large part because of their ongoing conflicts with the Gran colonists on their homeworld of Malastare.\n[P]Despite their short stature, most Dugs are quire strong, as is apparent from their muscular arms and legs. Dug culture has a decidedly stubborn and militaristic bent, and many Dugs believe that the potential greatness of their species repressed by the Republic, then the Empire, and most especially by the Grans. Centuries ago, during the ancient days of the Republic, the Grans moved to colonize Malastare as they expanded across the galaxy. Unsurprisingly, the Dugs fought violently against the efforts of the Gransto colonize their world. Though the Grans' technology exceeded that of the Dugs, the Dugs proved resourceful and unrelenting in the defense of their home, and the Grans were unprepared for the ferocity of the Dugs. The war grew increasingly brutal, and its escalation eventually led to an intervention by the Republic.\n[P]Unfortunately, due to the sway of the Gran colonists held with the Republic, it effectively awarded the planet to them during mediation. The Republic relocated most of the Dugs to the western continent while the Grans held the eastern continent. As a result of their defeat and the injustice they faced, many Dugs grew extremely xenophobic, and few held any love for the Republic. There have been no major reparations by the wider galactic community and no progress on helping to restore Dug independence in any meaningful sense, and so Dug frustrations with outsiders haven't significantly lessened the intervening centuries.\n[P]The most militant Dugs believe not only in their right to a sovereign planet, but also in the superiority of their own species. Their losses over the years have ingrained a great sense of hostility toward the rest of the galaxy in these hard-liners, and even inspire resentment and anger at other Dugs who are more willing to compromise in the name of results. Most Dugs are not so fanatical, of course, but the fact that the planet remains troubled by external and internecine conflicts alike does not help to resolve the situation.\n[P]During the Clone Wars, tensions rose again on Malastare between the belligerent factions. Unsurprisingly, Gran representatives held the Malastare seat in the Republic Senate, and during those troubling times, they strongly supported the Chancellor in his rise to power. In the days since the Emperor's ascension, the Gran occupiers' past loyalty has largely been ignored, and the Empire has installed a series of human government to rule Malastare. Many Dugs were initially amused by how Imperial authorities humiliated and demoted the Grans in ways resembling the treatment that the Dugs had received for centuries. However, years of harsh Imperial rule have worn away any real love for the Empire most Dugs might have once held. Dugs are still treated as the lesser citizens of their homeworld. Despite this, most Dugs living on Malastare grudgingly prefer the Empire's iron fisted reign to rule by the Gran occupiers, whom they see as the more despicable of the two. Imperial brutality is less effective against the Dugs, who meet it with their own ferocity in turn.\n[P]Reputation is of the utmost importance to traditionalist Dug families, and many clans claim a lineage from ancient, heroic figures from Dug history to prop up their position in Dug society. Some of these claims are true, though many are not, and refer to mythical figures whose existence cannot be verified. Even those hereditary claims that began as truth have usually been expanded, distorted and exaggerated over the years as the clans have jockeyed for the esteem granted by stories of powerful ancestors.\n[P]Dugs are technologically adept, but often have to adapt the technology of other species to make it useful to their unique physiology. In turn, Dug devices and weapons are generally rather difficult for members of other species to use.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Dugs are one-meter-tall humanoids with long upper limbs serving as legs, and with lower limbs that hang from their torso operate as their arms and hands. The genders are very similar in appearance, though males have loose, inflatable, neck-flaps reserved for mating rituals and calls. Dugs have long snouts that most species subconsciously read as expressing a permanent snarl. This perception likely plays into - and also helps to fuel - the Dugs' galactic reputation for confrontational and meanspirited interaction.\n[P]Long skin flaps at the ends of their snouts and ears are often adorned with beads or jewelry. Due to their dexterous feet, adapted to grasping branches and trunks in their native forest habitat. Dugs do not generally wear footwear. When they do, it tends to be similar to gloves to allow them to maintain the use of their digits when moving. Malastare's high gravity makes the Dugs especially strong and quick when they are on worlds with gravity at or lower than the galactic average.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Dugs are highly independent, and many hate to rely on anyone but themselves. Individuals must fend for themselves within their culture, which can often be very violent. Centuries of repression by the Gran settlers on Malastare have only intensified this belief in harsh self-sufficiency that many Dugs hold. Few aliens treat the Dugs with much respect, and so most Dugs respond in kind. Their natural us-against-the-galaxy attitude leads to constant conflicts. Despite their individualism, Dugs do band together around their clans, joining together against other families and various foes such as the Empire and the Grans.\n[P]Many Dugs would love nothing more than to expel the Gran interlopers and all the other off-worlders from Malastare, but the reality of the situation is that they lack the power to take back their planet. This leaves Dug society riven by conflict, both against the various groups of invaders and from within as disparate clans violently differ over the possible methods for addressing their shared problems. The growth and advancement of Dug technology has been severely limited and stunted by the meddling of off-worlders, and so the Dug voices seeking compromise rather than retribution are usually drowned out by the most quarrelsome elements of society.\n[P]Dug towns and other geopolitical regions are typically ruled by a powerful Dug king, queen or other titled individual who wins a position through prearranged combat. After the passing of a leader, the candidates battle to incapacitation or death. These are brutal contests with few rules and most of those are inevitably broken or manipulated as needed by the fighters. While there are Dugs who hold themselves to strict codes of honor, as within most species. Such individuals tend to find themselves outmaneuvered by more morally \"flexible\" opponents.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Dugs are native to the world of Malastare, but when the Old Republic Senate passed the so-called Gran Protectorate Act, it enabled the Gran colonists to take over the eastern continent and forced most of the Dugs to the western continent. To this day, the Dugs still struggle to protect their lands and keep the Gran at bay. They remain tree-dwellers with elaborate and chaotic treetop settlements or clusters of formidable towers. This gives them a great advantage in the forests over their foes. Enemies find it difficult to navigate pathways made for travelers with four prehensile limbs. Dug cities rarely equal those of the Grans in terms of technological power, however.\n[P]The Dugs are largely self-sufficient. They are technologically savvy despite the fact they must import a significant percentage or their technology and vehicles. This reality has allowed a certain amount of trade to occur between certain Dug settlements and Grans, while other Dugs prefer to deal with traders from off-world rather than the Grans. While Dug mannerisms and negotiation tactics often seem explosive and erratic to off-worlders, those traders who learn to parley with the Dugs on their own terms (and even better, in their own language) can often make substantial profits for their efforts.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Dugs have their own language and prefer to deal in it whenever possible. Some of this out of a desire to preserve their culture despite the Gran and Imperial colonizers living on Malastare: others do it out of stubborn refusal to change. Dugs can learn Basic, but few on Malastare do. Off-world, however, almost all Dugs learn Basic. They might also acquire some Huttese or a local language if it makes it easier to live or work in a given area or deal with their employer. Many spacers joke that Dugs always seem to gain an impressive grasp of the use of profanity in any language they know, though xenologists tend to dismiss this as a baseless stereotype.\n[P][B]Life on the Fringe:[b] Dugs leave Malastare for all sorts of reasons. Some seek to make their fortune, while others hope for glory on far-off racetracks or even in battles amid the stars. Unfortunately, the Dug reputation for brutality and ill-temperedness tends to land them in rough company when they seek employment off-world. Though many Dugs do overcome these stereotypes, the challenges they pose are not insubstantial. Even though many fringers know better than to judge individuals by the stories of their species passed around in cantinas and space docks, others are not so open-minded.\n[P]Many Dugs seek out professions where they can put their strength and agility to work for them. They might become involved in Podracing, swoop racing and any other pursuit that involves both fast vehicles and thrills. While they can make do with controls built for other species, Dugs quickly adapt to any craft they own to their atypical arrangement of arms and legs. Some make a good living in illegal races and gambling. Others work in repair shops, using their acquired know-how to soup up other beings' ships, while still more work as smugglers, soaring across the spacelanes at incredible speeds.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Ombidexterous : Dugs add [BOOST] to all\n            Coordination checks and to combat checks\n            when attacking with two weapons.</p><p>Reduced Silhouette : Dugs have a Silhouette of 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Brawl":{"mod":"Brawl","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"DUG"}},"_id":"vndl3GYZVNLqFj1T"}

Renowned for their quickness and adaptability, Aleena readily embrace adventure, often in the form of competitive sports, including Podracing. Some use their natural athleticism to fund their travels, working as entertainers or athletes. Others take on service with military groups. Their small stature makes them ideally suited to roles as explorers or scouts.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Aleena are a reptilian species. Their skin is covered in scales that typically range in color from tan to blue or purple. Their elongated skulls house two large eyes, a broad nose, and a large, tooth-filled mouth. The curvature of their mouth suggests a perpetual smile to many non-Aleena. Mature Aleena average about eighty centimeters in height.\n[P]Unlike many reptilian species, Aleena are warm-blooded. They maintain their body temperature in part through a particularly rapid digestive system, believed to be a by-product of the competitive nature of their homeworld. The ability to rapidly convert food into energy is tightly linked to the species’ characteristic quickness. Aleena are omnivores who typically prefer very spicy cuisine, but there is no clear physiological basis for this preference. Visitors to their homes and world are often surprised by the food's intensity.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Aleena are fiercely loyal to their families. In their native cultures, extended families dwell together, often sharing interlinked rooms within a larger structure. All Aleena within a village typically share blood ties.\n[P]This strong connection continues when they travel beyond their worlds of origin. It is rare for an Aleena to travel alone. Instead, family members commonly travel together. In cases where a single Aleena travels as a performer, relatives join the performer as an entourage. They rejoice in their kin’s success and offer comfort at times of disappointment.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Aleen Minor is an Inner Rim world and the species’ planet of origin. It held membership in the Galactic Senate for millennia. The world’s climate is unrelentingly harsh, and the planet is home to such vicious predators as sagcatchers. Frequent travelers, Aleena have colonized other worlds,including Aleen, a world in the Mid Rim that many galactic citizens understandably confuse with the Aleena world of origin. Their population has grown substantially through their travels, such that far more Aleena live elsewhere in the galaxy than on Aleen Minor.\n[P][B]Languages:[b] All Aleena are fluent in their native language of Aleena. Most also learn Basic, especially those who choose to travel from their homeworld.\n[P][B]Perception of the Force:[b] Aleena do not have their own distinct cultural Force tradition. As the Aleena were long-time members of the Galactic Republic, the Jedi Order typically inducted young Aleena who evinced Force sensitivity. Aleena familial loyalty sometimes created a conflict for Padawans. Family members reestablished contact with their children, and many Aleena Jedi spent their careers upon Aleena. This was officially frowned upon by the Jedi Order, because Aleena Jedi were seen as not contributing to the greater galaxy.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Silhouette : Aleena are smaller than average and count as silhouette 0.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 98 - Nexus of Power[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Coordination":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"starwarsffg","systemVersion":"1.801","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1678404227282,"lastModifiedBy":"vZRbTyFijXDPDjwI"}}

An amphibious species, they are excellent swimmers and have the ability to hold their breath for very long periods of time when under water. Though they resemble anthropomorphic catfish and have aqua-coloured skin, they do not have gills. All members of the Selkath race have venom-tipped, retractable claws. Similar to the Wookiees, the use of these claws in any form of combat is considered dishonorable and a sign of madness.\n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] As an aquatic species, the Selkath are skilled swimmers. They resemble anthropomorphic sting rays and have blue-,pink- or green-colored skin, which is patterned for underwater camouflage, and their mouths are bracketed by cephalic lobes. They tend to stroke these during conversation, analogous to the Human habit of stroking facial hair, such as mustaches.\n\n[P]All members of the Selkath race have retractable, venom-tipped claws. Similar to the Wookiees, the use of these claws in any form of combat or attack is considered dishonorable and a sign of madness; to do this is to give in to animal instincts unbecoming of a sentient species. The females Selkath differ from males by the presence of a number of tendrils at the back of their heads.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] With the formation of the Republic, the Selkath did not join, but adopted a policy of strict neutrality. Many millennia later, their planet was allowed to keep this neutrality intact due to the advantageous position granted to them by their monopoly on the supply of kolto. Kolto, produced solely on Manaan, is a liquid that contains unique healing properties. When the liquid is applied to wounds it increases the healing rate, and patients can even be immersed in it in special tanks for greater effect. During conflicts, the Selkath threaten to cut off the supply of kolto, unless both sides respect their neutrality.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Manaan is an aquatic planet in the Pyrshak system. It is home to the Selkath, an amphibious species. The planet is completely covered in water and is the only known source of the healing liquid, kolto, in the galaxy. Controlled by the Rakata during pre-Republic history, it became independent following the collapse of their Infinite Empire. In the years leading up to and during the Jedi Civil War, kolto was so important to the galaxy that the Selkath were able to use their monopoly to enforce their policy of neutrality and autonomy. \n\n[P]The only above-surface settlement on Manaan is the floating Ahto City. During the Jedi Civil War, both the Sith Empire and the Galactic Republic attempted to get an upper hand in the war by creating secret deals that would give them more kolto. Ultimately, however, the Selkath banned the Sith from Manaan for trying to overthrow the government.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Selkath is the language of the Selkath.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Medicine : Selkaths may begin the game with\none free rank in Medicine.</p><p>Amphibious: : Selkaths may breathe underwater\nwithout penalty and never suffer movement\npenalties for traveling through water.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"SELKATH"}},"_id":"xtqRXW5vKZW9IdC6"}
{"name":"Gran","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/GRAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Gran[h4]\n\nThe humanoid, three-eyed Gran are a familiar sight throughout the galaxy. Frequenting trade routes and spaceports, traveling in groups as merchants or tourists, the Gran seem to be everywhere. While they can hold their own if forced to fight, these self-proclaimed pacifists are natural talkers. Whether Gran are friendly and open or cunning and manipulative, they boast well-honed social skills. They have a knack for learning information that their source does not mean to give. At some point, most travelers have been the victim of a Gran's friendly barrage of questioning. \n\n[P]The Gran have a strong community spirit and work cooperatively for the good of all. They have evolved from peaceful herbivores; on their homeworld of Kinyen they were once the hunted rather than hunter, living in large groups for protection. However, the Gran have adapted since they took to the stars, sometimes even becoming hunters themselves, taking work as hired guns or bounty hunters. \n\n[P]There are colonies of Gran in many different sectors, as the species has dispersed throughout the galaxy quickly and enthusiastically. The most significant of their colonies are those on Hok and Malastare, where the local Gran regard themselves as natives. The Gran of these colonies have developed different social codes and practices to those still on Kinyen, who consider them only genetically similar. Colonies of Gran away from their homeworld are unlikely to remain a microcosm of Kinyen for long, even if they begin that way. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] The Gran have a keen sense of sight and can see beyond the spectrum of most sighted species, including infrared. They can also detect minute physiological changes among their own kind that reveal emotions. Gran have two stomachs and digest food slowly, allowing them to go without eating for days if need be. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] As a species, Gran are socialists and staunch pacifists, but not all individual Gran practice what their society preaches. Gran have a strong sense of community, and on Kinyen they raise their children for specific careers in order to benefit the community as a whole. This means that while the Gran are not unintelligent, their education can be somewhat limited. The Gran once lived in herds, relying on their numbers for safety. Now, Gran depend on their kin emotionally and hate solitude. In fact, loneliness can drive them insane, often criminally so. The harshest punishment for a Gran is exile, since having to leave his family and friends forever is a fate worse than death. \n\n[P]While most Gran accept the practicalities of their educational system, there are always exceptions. The occasional Gran may find the structure too rigid, and want to leave the planet to do something other than the role assigned to him. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Gran homeworld of Kinyen is in the Expansion Region. It is located on the Corellian Trade Spine, which is one reason the Gran have spread so far through the galaxy. Many Gran still live in the colorful cities of their homeworld, which delight their keen sense of sight. The planet boasts lush forests as well as large plains of goatgrass, a favorite food of the Gran. \n\n[P]For some Gran, Malastare is their homeworld and their origins on Kinyen merely history. A center of trade and podracing, this high-gravity planet owes its diversity to the influx of species, sentient and otherwise, arriving via the Hydian Way.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] All Gran speak Gran and almost certainly Basic, since they love to talk to everyone. When necessary, Gran learn the languages of other species too, rather than miss any chances of conversation.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>One rank in Charm : Gran may take one rank in Charm</p><p>Enhanced Vision : When making ranged combat or Perception checks, Gran remove up to [SETBACK][SETBACK] imposed due to environmental conditions or concealment (but not defense).</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Age of Rebellion Core Rulebook[h4][H4]Far Horizons[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GRAN"}},"_id":"y1WIXkexPfXa2Zbf"}
{"name":"Pantoran","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/PANTORAN.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Pantoran[h4]\nthese blue-skinned near-humans come from a cold climate and were vibrant participants in galactic society during the time of the Republic. In the time of the Galactic Civil War, the democratic and politically active Pantorans have found themselves in a precarious position in galactic politics, one rife with disaster but also promise.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Pantorans are a near-human species with skin of various shades of blue and yellow eyes (with some rare instances of black). Their hair ranges in color from black and blue to light purple and white. They have an average height similar to that of humans, a bit less than two meters. Their physiology allows them to be comfortable in lower temperatures, requiring only a couple of layers of casual clothing in icy climates. In all other aspects, Pantorans are nearly identical to humans.\n[P][B]Society:[b] Fiercely independent believers in freedom and democracy, the Pantorans still have small cultural hold-overs from a more feudal era. Pantorans wear yellow marks on their forehead, under their eyes, and on their cheeks to denote their family names and lineages. Most Pantorans have a general interest in genealogy and history, and enjoy spending time searching for long-lost relatives and connections to ancient heroes and historical figures. A few Pantorans still hold noble titles. Some also wear headwear and jewelry proudly denoting birthplaces and associated famous geographic regions where ancient Pantoran battles, treaties, artistic works, and the like occurred. However, in this current age, Pantorans have turned global politics and debate into an art form in the spirit of democracy.\n[P]Bitter and heated arguments rage across Pantoran society regarding the fate of their homeworld. When the Republic fell and the Galactic Empire ascended, Pantorans became deeply uncertain about their relationship with the galaxy. In both their democratic Assembly and public squares, three different camps have formed regarding Pantora's political future. One camp—the appeasers—considers integration with the Empire a pragmatic goal. With the Empire's recognition, Pantora would gain security both militarily and economically. Another camp insists on maintaining the ideals of the Republic. These traditionalists, or republicans, consider the Empire a betrayer of those ideals, although many also believe that the Rebels cannot truly restore the Republic. A growing few believe that Pantora needs to strike out on its own, to found new colonies and exploit new resources. These expansionists believe that they need to forge treaties with the nearby slavers and spice traders, but enough Pantorans see that direction as abhorrent and any such bill dies on the Assembly floor.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The far Outer Rim wold of Pantora, a moon of the ice world Orto Plutonia, is located halfway between Suarbi and Alzoc in the Sujimis sector. Surrounded by slavers and spice traders, Pantorans consider themselves the last holdover of the Republic, complete with a democratic Assembly. The Assembly's highest executive position is that of the Chairman. Second in leadership and head of the legislative branch is the Speaker of the Assembly, who keeps the Chairman's power in check.\n[P]Somewhat isolated from the rest of the galaxy, Pantora doesn't suffer direct oppression from the Empire, but the loss of the Republic has meant the loss of resources and money from the Senate. Pantora has been alone for the past two decades, struggling against the lawlessness of its neighboring systems. As a result, it has slowly built up a small navy of patriots and volunteers. The Assembly fears that making the navy any larger, though, might attract the attention of the Empire.\n[P]Individual members of the Assembly have made their own undocumented deals with other planets for resource, technology, information, and even mercenaries. The Assembly turns a blind eye as long as the deals don't threaten the security of Pantora or its citizens. As time goes on, however, the likelihood of an incident forcing Pantora to exercise to sovereignty increases. Most Pantorans hope for this to occur later rather than sooner, especially as the Galactic Civil War rages on without a clear winner.\n[P][B]Language:[b] Another vestige of Pantoran feudal culture is found in the various dialects of its language. Each dialect is distinct enough that communication, though possible, is difficult. For this reason, when the Pantorans originally joined the Galactic Senate, they adopted Basic as their official global language, and now Basic is the first language of most Pantoran children. The homeworld's education continues to emphasize a Republic-inspired curriculum, so Pantoran and its various dialects are slowly becoming unfashionable. Nevertheless, distinct Pantoran accents still permeate their spoken Basic. In addition, some Pantorans encourage private language education. Most end up learning a practical trade language, such as Huttese.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Cool : Pantorans may begin the game with one rank in Cool.</p><p>Tundra Dweller : When making skill checks, Pantorans may remove [SETBACK] imposed due to cold environmental conditions.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 22 - Endless Vigil[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"PANTORAN"}},"_id":"yDGWFcF376nqRDOs"}
{"name":"Gotal","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/GOTAL.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Gotal[h4]\n\nThe shaggy-haired Gotals are an empathetic race of many talents and a benevolent nature. They possess the extraordinary ability to detect and interpret almost every manner of energy field, which allows them to sense the moods and well-being of nearby living beings. \n\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Gotals are tall, burly humanoids that evolved as hunter-gatherer tribes on the harsh plains of Antar 4. A coarse, dense layer of fur covers these rugged bipeds in shades ranging from sandy brown to smoky gray. Tiny vestigial nostrils, a pair of beady red eyes, and a wide grimace adorn their gristly, elongated faces. From their heavily knobbed brow sprouts a pair of conical bovid horns packed with millions of nerve clusters sensitive to electromagnetic fields, radio waves, and numerous other forms of energy. Gotals use their energy-detecting horns as their primary sensory organs, since the peculiar conditions of their moon make it difficult to function by sight alone. \n\n[P]Gotals use their energy sensitivity to detect the presence, mood, and general wellbeing 'of nearby living creatures through their electromagnetic aura. On their home, Gotals employ this sensitivity to stalk herds of quivry and other prey-beasts with ease. Their ability to discern the emotions of others through brain wave patterns and other electromagnetic emanations forms the basis of their entire way of life. \n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Antar 4's harsh, unpredictable environment (caused by its complex orbital cycle within a binary star system) forced the Gotals' primitive ancestors into a nomadic lifestyle. Limited success with planting crops meant the hunter-gatherers of early Gotal civilization had to follow herd beasts during their migration in order to survive. Gotal hunters used their remarkable ability to detect herds and could discern the type, number, and well-being of animals with astonishing accuracy. Although Gotal settlers have since established several cities around their world, some Gotals reject the settlers' lifestyle and honor their ancestral traditions by roaming the Antarian plains. These rugged folk roam the highlands and valleys and seldom encounter settlement dwellers in cities like the sprawling Baal Commune. \n\n[P]The Gotal's ability to decipher the emotional state of others using their energy-sensitive horns played a central role in shaping their society. Their proficiency at detecting anger and discomfort produced a natural aversion to conflict; therefore, Gotals live free of any established government and maintain a peaceful anarchy. Awareness of the emotions of everyone around them makes courting rituals unnecessary, and Gotals often fall in love at first sight, remaining monogamous for life. Gotals are typically polite and \ndiscreet in their social interactions, avoiding expressing negative opinions to keep from upsetting others. There are exceptions, however, and some Gotals use their abilities to take advantage of others, often leaving their world to pursue lives of crime. \n\n[P]Gotal children are abrasive and temperamental. From birth, Gotals endure bombardment of every conceivable form of energy emission, unable to filter the incoming stimuli. The sensory overload leaves them helpless, sometimes-causing catatonia or delirium. After infancy, Gotals start learning to cope with their ability, but they still struggle with bouts of instability until they reach maturity around twelve years of age. \n\n[P]Although Gotals struggle with the electromagnetic interference given off by electronic devices, they have adapted and achieved space travel capabilities using technology employing emission-free chemical reactions. Gotals used this technology to explore the other moons and planets of their solar system long before encountering other species, and they even established mining outposts on Antar 5 to advance their civilization. Gotals have had millennia to adapt to the overwhelming energy fields wrought by other species that lack their unique abilities, but they continue to struggle with droid technology. Power sources used in most modern droids emit an energy pattern that causes Gotals particular discomfort, which has created an anti-droid sentiment within Gotal society. \n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Antar 4 is one of six moons orbiting a gas giant in the binary star system known as the Antar system. The complex orbital pattern of moons, planet, and suns causes erratic weather patterns and a constantly changing diurnal cycle. Antar 4 lies along the Nanth'ri Trade Route in the Inner Rim. Antar 4's land mass consists primarily of breezy grass plains and rocky steppes, but over sixty percent of the moon's surface is covered in oceans, rivers, and streams. Despite the cool climate, Antar 4 lacks polar ice caps due to a bizarre rotational pattern caused by its steep axis along the Antar system's orbital plane. This abnormal angle causes extreme tidal shifts that wrack the moon with harsh weather conditions as its seasons change. \n\n[P]Frequent eclipses caused by the Antar gas giant and its other moons subject Antar 4 to a highly variable diurnal cycle. At times, Antar's twin stars, along with the reflectivity of the gas giant's atmosphere, bathes the entire moon in sunlight that is so bright that it would scorch the optic nerves of most species. Other times, the planet moves between its double stars and this moon, plunging Antar 4 into total darkness. Between these two extremes, the Antarian moons provide varying radiance and wavelengths of illumination for the Gotal homeworld after nightfall. This wild orbital behavior makes it difficult for anything other than hearty, fast-growing plant life to take root.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] Antarian primarily relies upon the reading of brain waves and electromagnetic auras to decipher emotions and basic concepts, and supplements this with speech used to convey abstract or complex ideas. To other species, the vocalization of Antarian sounds like a gurgled monotone, but to Gotals it has breadth and inflection thanks to the ever-shifting modulation created by the moods and thoughts of those around them. Due to their ability to detect these emotions with their horns, the Gotal language has no words to express concepts like happiness or sadness. The extra sense Gotals use to communicate makes it impossible for other living beings to speak Antarian fluently. \n\n[P]Gotals speak Basic to interact with other species, but using vocalized speech to express emotion is a concept too foreign for most Gotals to grasp. Therefore, when Gotals use Basic, they speak in neutral terms devoid of any emotion or emphasis. This dull monotone often brings the sincerity of Gotals into question. Superstition that Gotals can read minds also leaves non-Gotals unsettled, widening the rift between species.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Energy Sensitivity : Once per encounter as a maneuver, may sense the presence and current emotional states of all living things within short range.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Fly Casual[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":9,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":8,"exclude":true},"Perception":{"mod":"Perception","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"GOTAL"}},"_id":"ySXsXf3eraSmioRb"}
{"name":"Kyuzo","type":"species","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/species/KYUZO.png","data":{"description":"[H4]Kyuzo[h4]\nKyuzo are lanky, bipedal humanoids who hail from the\nworld of Phatrong. Their frequently slender physique\nbelies their formidable strength and surprising agility.\nKyuzo are not a prominent species in the galaxy at\nlarge, but some travel extensively for business, trade,\nand exploration.\n[P]There are many social and political organizations on\ntheir homeworld Phatrong, but one particularly noteworthy cultural phenomenon is that of clovocs, groups\nthat maintain law and order in specific regions. The\nmembers of the most elite clovocs on Phatrong are\nrenowned for their skill and honor, and are thus valued by military recruiters, underworld organizations,\nand other groups that require skilled fighters.\n[P][B]Physiology:[b] Kyuzo are green-skinned, and display\nhues ranging from lighter olive shades to deep bluegreen colors. They are bipedal, with thin arms and\nlegs that conceal their considerable strength. Their\nhands have four digits. Due to the uncommon makeup\nof their homeworld’s atmosphere, Kyuzo frequently\nwear filter masks when in a galactic standard habitable environment. Though going without these masks\nisn’t fatal, doing so makes Kyuzo ill in a short time,\ninterferes with their ability to concentrate, and slows\nthem down considerably. Like many species, Kyuzo\nspan a broad range in term s of height and build, with\nsome members of the species towering over most\nhumans and others considerably smaller in stature.\n[P]Interestingly, there are two primary phenotypes\nwithin the Kyuzo population; some have compound\neyes, while others have eyes with pupils akin to those of humans. The exact genetic history behind this divergence is known to few non-Kyuzo scholars, but the two groups are genetically compatible, with offspring inheriting one trait or the other from a parent.\n[P][B]Society:[b] The Kyuzo are a highly political species.\nStarting with early city-states, the Kyuzo developed\nsocieties that spanned considerable geographic\nareas. Most Kyuzo identify as members of a particular\ncountry or region. Separate from these governments\nare the clovocs, which are organizations of warriors\nand o their combatants that have their own traditions\nand rules outside of the political regions they inhabit.\n[P]At their best, the clovocs comprise noble fighters\nstanding for what is right or just. At their worst, they\nare bands of vile mercenaries or criminals who are as\nformidable as they are greedy. Clovocs range in size\nfrom a few dozen members to thousands of individuals. All forms of Kyuzo government make deals with\nthe clovocs to provide security and military forces.\nThe politics behind the successful hiring of a clovoc\nare complex and sometimes outright corrupt. Many\na government has been toppled when a clovoc abandoned it for better pay elsewhere or as an extreme\nform of protest over that government’s actions,\nthough few clovocs would abandon a battlefield for\nsuch reasons when actual fighting is underway.\n[P]Some clovocs encourage their members or even\nentire branches to work offworld as mercenaries,\nwhile others forbid this practice. While most Kyuzo\nare not actually members of a clovoc, these organizations nonetheless hold an important place in Kyuzo\nculture, and are often romanticized in works of song,\nliterature, and other art. Though the clovocs are not\nmonolithic on Phatrong—some regions have more traditional governance structures with integrated\nmilitaries—they are common in several of the largest\nnations. Further, because many Kyuzo who travel offworld are members of a clovoc, these warrior orders\nare one of the most widely recognized elements of\nKyuzo culture in the galaxy at large.\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] Phatrong is an Outer Rim world, in the\ngalactic vicinity of Yavin and the Gordian Reach. It is\nterrestrial, with vast oceans divided by thin, mountainous, roughly linear continents that stretch between the\nplanet's poles. Some mountain ranges are bordered\nby wide plains and low hills. Others rise steeply out\nof the water, forming fjords and long inland canyons.\n[P]Kyuzo cities are scattered throughout the continents. Most continents and major islands are their\nown political units, though they do form a loose confederation that once elected the planet’s Republic\nand Imperial Senators—before the dissolution of the\nSenate, at least. The office of the local Imperial governor has since replaced that function, and oversees\nthe world directly. The Imperials naturally rely on their\nown forces to maintain control, and only deal with the\nclovocs if they absolutely must. The reputation of the\nclovocs has made the Empire cautious on Phatrong,\nand as long as taxes are paid on time, it generally\nexerts little direct influence over the world.\n[P]Phatrong is a technologically developed world with\nall of the expected amenities and technologies available to most worlds of the Galactic Empire. The Kyuzo\nhave a local style they apply to many of their products and services. For those in the know, imported\ngoods usually stand out.\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Kyuzo have their own language, made\nup of quickly spoken short words and phrases. They\ncan learn to understand Basic without difficulty, and\nmost pick up the skill at a young age, though speaking it is another matter. Some Kyuzo learn to make\nthemselves understood in Basic while others use\ntranslation devices to smooth their interactions with\noutsiders. Most clovocs laud action over words, and\nso some Kyuzo warriors who leave Phatrong simply let\ntheir deeds speak for themselves.\n[P][B]Life in the Alliance:[b]  Kyuzo fighters who share the\nAlliance’s goals are quickly welcomed. Their combat\nprowess is highly respected and provides a much-needed boost to units or resistance groups lacking\nfighting ability. Those fighters looking for payment\nmight find limited work with the rebels, but only if they\nare desperate for hired help, and if the clovoc involved\nhas a decent reputation.\n[P]Kyuzo rebel sympathizers on Phatrong work tirelessly to recruit like-minded individuals in hopes that\nthey can bolster both the Alliance at large, and form\nthe core of a major resistance force on their homeworld. Many Kyuzo who join the Rebel Alliance are\nnot members of a clovoc at all. Though the clovocs\ndominate the military culture of Phatrong, some fighters still make a living working as lone freelancers.\nOther recruits are not combatants at all, and support\nthe Rebel Alliance with diplomatic guidance, scientific\nbreakthroughs, or entirely unique expertise developed on, or off, Phatrong.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Dense Musculature : Once per round as a maneuver, may suffer 3 strain to leap horizontally or vertically to any location within medium range.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 22 - Forged in Battle[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":3,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":1,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":11,"exclude":true},"Coordination":{"mod":"Coordination","modtype":"Skill Rank","value":1,"exclude":false}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"KYUZO"}},"_id":"yX7vOG75MT0c9q4V"}

Very uniquely Ryn in nature, are their beak-like noses that contain fluted holes. These holes allow the Ryn to play their 'beaks' like flutes. This talent has been used to communicated between Ryn and has uniquely been observed in communication with droids.\n\n[P][B]Society:[b] Due to their homelessness, musical talent, natural secrecy, and avoidance of written records, Ryn developed a nomadic culture and a reputation for confidence games, leaving many species prejudiced against them. In some sectors it is legal to enslave or hunt Ryn. Their language is outlawed in many locations, and a large number of Ryn women are used as slave breeding stock.\n\n[P]The largest concentration of Ryn is located in the Corporate Sector due to the fact that it is far from those who would persecute them.  The Ryn claim to have invented sabacc, originally as a means of divination. They are a very musical people, being able to play their beaks like flutes. They can even call droids with them, by being able to play pitches very precisely.\n\n[P][B]Homeworld:[b] The Ryn homeworld has been lost in time and space.  Not even the Ryn remember where they came from, and most are vagabonds, living throughout the Core Worlds without a home of their own.\n\n[P][B]Language:[b] The Ryn language is the native language of the Ryn species. It uses tones and inflections and is easily described as melodious by anyone who hear it. Since childhood, Ryns are taught both the Ryn language and Basic, to get more easily integrated into the galactic society, although they are usually only literate in their own language.<h4>Abilities</h4><p>Deception : Ryn may begin the game with one\nfree rank in Deception.</p><p>Prehensile Tail : Ryn can use their tails to hold\nand manipulate small items, but cannot use\nthat item to make an attack.</p>[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Unofficial Species Menagerie[h4]","attributes":{"Brawn":{"mod":"Brawn","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Agility":{"mod":"Agility","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Intellect":{"mod":"Intellect","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Cunning":{"mod":"Cunning","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Willpower":{"mod":"Willpower","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Presence":{"mod":"Presence","modtype":"Characteristic","value":2,"exclude":true},"Wounds":{"mod":"Wounds","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true},"Strain":{"mod":"Strain","modtype":"Stat","value":10,"exclude":true}}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"RYN"}},"_id":"zPrr6WN9uzHgdiBl"}
