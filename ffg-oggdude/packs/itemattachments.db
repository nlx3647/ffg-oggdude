This is called a component alteration.\n[P]Characters wishing to break a weapon or other item down into several parts in this fashion need to spend time dismantling the device into smaller components. This requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Mechanics check[b] and takes a number of hours equal to the item's encumbrance, or a minimum of one hour.

While this allows a part to take on the rough appearance of the desired object, it does not gain the functionality of that object. This is generally a taxing and tricky process, and so upgrades the difficulty of the Mechanics check once or more as per the GM's discretion.\n[P]Each [SU] or [TR] on the initial Mechanics check lets a character carrying the components from a component alteration add [BO] to [B]opposed Stealth vs. Perception checks[b] when an observer attempts to notice the true nature of the disassembled device.

Whereas electronic countermeasures affect an opposing ship or vehicle's sensors, physical countermeasures are specifically designed to help a ship or vehicle evade incoming missiles or torpedoes. Countermeasures come in three basic varieties—chaff, flares, and anti-warhead missile pods. Chaff is a collection of small, highly reflective alloy streamers packed into a tube with a small explosive charge. When detonated, the chaff tube creates a cloud of glittering shrapnel that clouds detection systems and confuses most basic missile guidance systems. Flares are deployed in groups from special launchers, and consist of small incendiary devices that mimic the heat produced by a ship or vehicle's engines, fooling incoming missiles into following the super-hot flare instead of the vehicle. Anti-warhead missile pods are similar to flares, but they fire a cluster of small, low-yield missiles designed to intercept and destroy incoming ordnance. \n\n[P]While any ship equipped with physical counter-measures carries enough to get them through most encounters, engaging in a long, drawn-out fight can quickly deplete a launcher's store of countermeasures.

While each brand uses its own patented gravitic technology, gravity mines and their launchers share a number of common traits. The mines range anywhere from the size of a slim datapad to a meter across, depending on their intended use, and are packed with advanced gravity well generation systems. When deployed, gravity mines create a localized area of intense gravity that can reduce the output of repulsorlift drives or even shut them down completely, stopping a speeder in its tracks. While they are often used in military installations to restrict ship or vehicle access to sensitive areas or to create firing lanes for weapon emplacements, they can also be used in sabotage or to lay traps for incoming ships or airspeeders. Gravity mine launchers are simple box-type launchers mounted on landspeeders that allow a vehicle crew to lay a minefield with relative ease. \n\n[P]The character piloting or operating the weapons on a vehicle equipped with a gravity mine launcher can deploy a single gravity mine anywhere on the ground within close range by spending an action. Once the mine is deployed, it automatically attaches to any other starship or vehicle using repulsorlifts that comes within close range of it. For every 1 mine attached to a vehicle that uses the Piloting (Planetary) skill, that vehicle reduces its speed by 1.

The needs of the moment, or the personal tastes of the Force user, dictate what form each kit takes. Sometimes a hilt may be disguised as a cane; at other time it could be hidden as a part of a more mundane weapon like a blaster rifle; it may even appear to be something much more ordinary, like  a pair of microbinoculars.

This is called a component alteration.\n[P]Characters wishing to break a weapon or other item down into several parts in this fashion need to spend time dismantling the device into smaller components.
