The manuals are sold in single-use, read-only datapads that contain all the information needed to make repairs, and feature expandable, three-dimensional parts diagrams with constantly updated parts numbers and a wireless connection to the galactic holonet. They also include a diagnostic program that assists in maintenance and repair by using the vehicle's onboard computer to trace circuits and find faults within systems.

These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. \n\n[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. \n\n[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there.

The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without wining the tenor of the game. \n\n[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine.

The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses. \n\n[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user. [B]Two skills, determined by the holocron, become career skills for the holocron's user as long as it remains in the user's possession.[b] What these skills are depends on the holocron in question (see [B]Table 2-7: Holocron Skills[b], on page 109, for some examples of skill pairs).

{"name":"Q7-Series Astromech Droid","type":"gear","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/gear/GearDROIDQ7.png","data":{"description":"[H3]Q7-Series Astromech Droid[h3]\n\nThe Q7 was the result of a joint venture between Industrial Automaton and Kuat Systems Engineering. Designed specifically for use in KSE's A3 Nimbus short-range interceptor, the Q7 is unique among IA's astromech droid catalog in both construction and personality. Using design specifications and access to the Nimbus' advanced new software architecture, IA developed its new droid specifically for use in the new fighter, a process that both companies felt would be a growing trend in the near future. After numerous failed prototypes, IA finally perfected the interface systems and the brand new Q7 was revealed along with the Nimbus to overwhelming praise from both the military and civilian sectors. \n\n[P]Unlike any of Industrial Automaton's astromech droids on the market at that time, the Q7 is as visually striking as it is competent. Combining the sensor dome of an R2-series with a lower hemisphere containing a miniaturized repulsorlift generator, the Q7 is a perfect alloy sphere roughly one meter across at its widest. The droid's body style was dictated by the size of the Nimbus, which is an incredibly tiny fighter, and the locations in which designers could find space. The ability to go anywhere, anytime, and to get itself into and out of its droid socket with no outside assistance was one of the Q7's biggest selling points, and one that played very well with those interested in military logistics and planning. The droid's programming and its ability to interface so seamlessly with the A3 was touted as the next step in astromech droid development. Many thought that having a droid built specifically for a given ship represented a significant step forward, as it meant that the droid and the craft could work in perfect tandem. The positive buzz around the Q7 lasted right up until the Republic Navy took delivery of the A3 fighters and their attendant droids, and then some ugly truths became quickly apparent. \n\n[P]As the Republic Navy became more familiar with the Q7 and its quirks, it became clear that the little droid was drastically limited in both scope and utility. The fact that it was built solely for the Nimbus meant that, while it was quite good at operating that fighter, thanks to its size, shape, and bespoke programming the A3 was the only fighter with which it worked well. The Q7 lacked the programming and the hardware to interface with any other ship or vehicle in the Republic Navy inventory, which, compared to the current R2 and R3 series droids, made it unsuitable for most work undertaken by Navy droids, such as the repair and maintenance of ships. In addition, the Q7's personalities, such as they were, were so single-minded and focused on their specific fighters that they were difficult to work with when doing anything other than flying the A3. Aside from their programming and personalities, the droids' repulsorlift system proved to be finicky, high maintenance, and hard to repair in the inevitable event of a break down. All of this added up to make the 07 perhaps the most loathed droid series in IA's history and a black mark on its otherwise sterling reputation. \n\n[P]After the initial run of Q7s were produced for the Navy's A3 fighters, production was ceased and all back stock Q7s were sold at fire sale prices to civilians and local governments throughout the galaxy. With the collapse of the Republic and the rise of the Empire came the retirement of the A3 and the development of the new TIE-series fighters, which also meant retirement for the numerous Q7s in the inventory. Many were simply scrapped with their fighters and either recycled or returned to IA for parting out. Those that survived were typically reprogrammed as well as possible to work as general astromech droids and transplanted into surplus R2 and R3 bodies. Today, it's rare to find a functioning Q7, and even rarer to find one in its original body. Those that are still around are typically found in out-of-the-way places where their low cost and admittedly strong grasp of astromechanics make them an attractive investment.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Stay on Target[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":6500,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[],"adjusteditemmodifer":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"DROIDQ7"}},"_id":"2BWS9t92dwVTYUk5"}

A product of the notoriously corrupt and rapacious Loronar Corporation, the I-SX was introduced during the early years of the Galactic Empire as a \"programming and computer sciences\" droid, marketed toward educational institutions and technology companies. Loronar being Loronar, however, the droid was in fact a dedicated slicer unit geared toward industrial espionage and military intelligence. Along with the aboveboard marketing, Loronar used all of its corporate might to peddle these droids to any law enforcement or government intelligence agency that would take them, including the Empire and various factions within the Rebel Alliance. While the ISB and Imperial military Intelligence agencies demurred, having already signed contracts with Arakyd and MerenData to purchase espionage and slicer droids, the Alliance snapped LSx droids up in bulk to bolster its small intelligence corps.\n[P]LSx-series droids are humanoid-shaped constructs just under two meters tall, with spindly limbs and a long, animal-like head reminiscent of Baktoid's old B1 battle droids. They are equipped with cutting-edge slicer gear and powerful programming and data analysis firmware easily rivaling that of most intelligence agencies and criminal organizations. Packed into their hands and bulky forearms is an array of fine manipulators, computer probes, scomp links, circuit chasers, and other electronics and computer repair tools that allow the droids to access anything from a datapad to a military-grade mainframe. Mounted between the knuckles of their right hand, they even carry a scomp-spiker, a highly illegal piece of industrial espionage and sabotage equipment that pours a devastating high-voltage charge through a computer system to destroy both hardware and software. Although they are not programmed for combat, LSx-series droids can defend themselves if necessary, and the scomp-spiker makes for an extremely nasty weapon against both organics and droids. \n[P]These droids rarely speak, and when they do it is in a nearly indecipherable patois of technical jargon, acronyms, and academic pedantry. However, LSx-series droids that have gone without regular maintenance and memory wipes often learn to express themselves in ways less likely to bore and drive away colleagues. Some develop obsessive and deeply sarcastic personalities. The Rebel Alliance currently uses the majority of LSx-series droids that have been produced, typically assigning them to base duty where they work endless hours attempting to crack Imperial military network security.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 51 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":19000,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":true},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[],"adjusteditemmodifer":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"LSXSLICERDROID"}},"_id":"6prmMbqAVkEKJtyy"}

These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. \n\n[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. \n\n[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one. \n\n[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives.

The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without wining the tenor of the game. \n\n[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses. \n\n[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user. [B]Two skills, determined by the holocron, become career skills for the holocron's user as long as it remains in the user's possession.[b] What these skills are depends on the holocron in question (see [B]Table 2-7: Holocron Skills[b], on page 109, for some examples of skill pairs).

Trill was an exemplar of the philosophy of hunting that ecologists promote, carefully choosing her marks from overpopulated game species or stalking the rare rogue predators that target sapients. She insisted that hunting was a meditative act, and she claimed to owe her phenomenal success to the Force-enabled connection she shared with her quarry.\n[P]Although she was an accomplished Jedi, Trill was careful never to use the order’s signature weapon, her lightsaber, in the hunt. Instead, she adopted the tools and weapons of the local hunters in whatever environment she found herself, thus mastering a dizzying array of techniques and technologies. She was not above modifying the accoutrements she came across in her travels, however, and at least one example of her tinkering is thought to have survived to the present day. Rumored to be stored in a hunting lodge deep in Devaron’s Blue Mountains, the Force-imbued goggles known as the Eyes of Laqasa miniaturize the functions of high-end electrobinoculars within a pair of crystalline lenses set into a leather headband. It is those crystal lenses, and the powers the Jedi invested in them, that mark the Eyes of Laqasa as a powerful Force artifact.\n[P]The particular impetus for the invention of the Eyes of Laqasa is a Devaronian legend. Late in Laqasa Trill’s life, a male hunter secretly and illegally imported a troop of large predators that shared the characteristics of simians and reptiles. Their world of origin is unknown to this day, but what made the animals unique, even more than their viciousness, was their Force-enabled chameleon ability, a trait that had evolved in the beasts to such an extent that they were practically invisible in natural surroundings. The hunter released the troop into a supposedly enclosed hunting sanctuary, which they promptly escaped after slaying their would-be killer and his game wardens.\n[P]For the next two years, the troop wreaked havoc on the ecosystem of Devaron’s northern continent, ranging far and wide and eluding the finest hunters on the planet. It was then that Laqasa Trill arrived, making one of her infrequent visits to her homeworld. When she learned of the situation, she vowed to end the threat posed by the alien predators once and for all. Taking only what she could carry on her back, the idiosyncratic huntress disappeared into the wilderness.\n[P]The Jedi was never known to take trophies except for this instance. When she returned to civilization over a year later, she wore an ankle-length, color-shifting cloak woven from the hides of her prey. She also wore a set of goggles she had constructed in the course of her hunt, and she recorded in her journals that she owed not only her success to the Eyes, but her very life.\n[P]When wearing the Eyes of Laqasa, Force-sensitive characters remove all [SE] imposed due to darkness, concealment, camouflage, or similar effects, and can see normally as if in normal daylight.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 108 - Nexus of Power[h4]<div>A Force-sensitive character removes all [SE] imposed due to darkness, concealment, camouflage, or similar effects. </div><div>A Force-sensitive character can see in the dark as if in normal daylight. </div>","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":2000,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[null,null],"adjusteditemmodifer":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"TALISEYESLAQ"}},"_id":"C02U4ZnISDRUd8Wu"}

One example from Dagobah’s extensive catalog of vegetative wonders is the dolina ring seed, samples of which are held by several universities and agribusiness concerns throughout the galaxy. Although the samples’ provenance is now unknown, their unusual shape and mysterious properties continue to be studied by scientists.\n[P]The seeds are just that, embryonic plants forming both the culmination and the beginning of the life cycle of an unknown angiosperm. However, unlike the vast majority of coated seeds that have been cataloged from across known space, dolina ring seeds are not spherical or ovoid. Instead, the hardened fruit layer, or endocarp, surrounding and fused to the actual seed material takes the form of a woody ring about three centimeters in diameter. This unique shape has long fascinated biologists, who seek to learn what form of plant might grow from a ring. However, no dolina ring seeds have ever germinated away from the soggy soils of Dagobah, so no one now living knows what manner of shrub, flowering plant, or tree might grow from them.\n[P]Normally, thus stymied, scientists would turn their attention to some other wonder, but the dolina ring seeds have characteristics that make them fascinating on their own. For one thing, they are near-indestructible, capable of withstanding tremendous pressures, extremes of temperature, and baths of caustic and corrosive chemicals with little or no physical evidence of trauma to their outer coatings. Another property unusual in a clearly biological artifact is the seeds' extraordinary density. Though small enough to be held in the palm of a human’s hand, and even of a size and shape appropriate to be worn as jewelry on some sentients’ fingers, dolina ring seeds mass in at an incredible nine kilograms on average, making them some of the heaviest known plant matter.\n[P]There is another characteristic of dolina ring seeds, known to only the very few Force-sensitive scientists who have studied them, kept as a closely guarded secret. Their Force reactivity was first discovered and described by a Sullustan agronomist in the employ of a Mid Rim foodstuffs company just a few years after the end of the Clone Wars. All of this scientist’s research, and the scientist herself, were promptly confiscated by agents of the Empire. Around the same time, a human farmer and chemist working independently came across a dolina ring seed in a lot of seed stocks he had purchased as part of a load of salvage from a Trandoshan junk dealer. Unaware of the scant findings that had been published about the ring seeds, this man at first kept the sample as a simple curiosity. It was only when an Imperial sweep of his planet for Force sensitives targeted his young daughter that the ring’s value became apparent.\n[P]Seeking to protect his daughter from Inquisitorial kidnapping, the farmer hid her in his laboratory while he tried to convince the Imperial agents that she was offworld with her mother. A quick records check showed the agents that the farmer was in fact a widower, and then the casual brutality of the Empire evinced itself as they shot the man in cold blood. Overhearing the execution, the girl cast about desperately for anything that might save her, and it was then that the innate Force abilities that had attracted the attention of the Inquisition in the first place reacted with the dolina ring seed.

{"name":"E522 Assassin Droid","type":"gear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]E522 Assassin Droid[h3]\nThe E522 is one of the most feared droids operating in the galaxy today. These burly, hard-hitting droids were originally designed during the buildup to the Clone Wars by Techno Union member corporation Baktoid Combat Automata (BCA). Initially part of BCA's successful B-series battle droid line, the E522 was envisioned as a light anti-armor and anti-aircraft unit that would provide heavy support to platoons of B1 and B2 units. They were seen as too expensive and complex to serve as disposable droid soldiers, however, and the project was scrapped in favor of the B2 and B3 battle droid units.\n[P]When the Clone Wars finally ended with the destruction of both the Republic and the Separatists, the Techno Union dissolved, and its member corporations either struck out on their own or were brought under direct Imperial control. BCA was one of the companies nationalized by the Empire, and it was immediately slated for breakup. Through the process of BCA's breakup and the selling off of its various assets, all data from the E522 project fell into the hands of Sienar Intelligence Systems. SIS had been working on plans for its own line of combat and assassin droids, and the acquisition of the E522 R&D data was a huge boon to its project. SIS quickly scrapped its in-house project and poured an immense amount of time and money into bringing the E522 project to fruition. Within a year, the first E522s rolled out of SIS's assembly line and straight into the growing unrest leading up to the Galactic Civil War.\n[P]As much a front-line combat droid as an assassin unit, the E522 is a massive, hulking construct festooned with heavy weapons and covered in thick, military-grade armor. It has a rounded, diamond-shaped torso with no discernible head, an extremely narrow waist that rotates 360 degrees, and two heavy tank treads covered in armored skirts in place of legs. Two long, multi-jointed arms sprout from armored shoulders and are equipped with a heavy repeating blaster, heavy ion blaster, and rapid-fire needler gun in place of hands. Three smaller arms with highly dexterous hands are mounted low on the droid's torso to take care of fine work, and a mini-missile launcher is mounted to the droid's back. Scattered about the droid's body is an array of sensors, antennae, and photoreceptors that grant the E522 560-degree full-spectrum vision. The vision system, combined with a powerful on-board combat computer and targeting system, makes these droids a terror on the battlefield.\n[P]There are currently fewer than one hundred E522 droids operating in the galaxy. Most of these are in active service with Imperial Army Intelligence and the Imperial Security Bureau as assassins and support units for various Imperial black ops. These droids, with their regular memory wipes and maintenance, retain the silent and intimidating personalities that their Sienar programmers gave them. A handful have fallen into the hands of the Alliance, mostly as battlefield salvage. They are serving the Alliance well in roles similar to those in which they served the Empire. E522s in the Alliance have developed gruff, demanding, cynical personalities that agents who work with them describe as \"like everyone's least favorite Master Sergeant.\" Despite this, Alliance E522s are well liked and respected for their bravery and competence in the field.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 50 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":61000,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":8,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":true},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[],"adjusteditemmodifer":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"E522ASSDROID"}},"_id":"KLm66cmm7wjlRumC"}
{"name":"Taradon's Helm","type":"gear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Taradon's Helm[h3]\nSomewhere in the icy wastes of Hum, the wreckage of a starfighter serves as the tomb of the Jedi Taradon, a Corellian human possessed of extraordinary prowess as a pilot. Taradon was a member of the Jedi Order in the early days of the Republic. If legends are to be believed, he pursued evildoers with blade and blaster for almost a century before disappearing while fighting off a raid of the Jedi-protected planet Hum.\n[P]Taradon is known to have brought dozens of galactic criminals to justice, but unlike other famous Jedi Knights, he rarely met his foes face to face. Instead, he haunted the spacelanes, ghosting in and out of hyperspace at the controls of one of the half-dozen starfighters and gunboats he is known to have piloted. Whether acting on his own or at the behest of the Jedi Council, the human always preferred to stalk his prey while safely ensconced in a cockpit, where his preternatural skills and technical acumen eventually led him to develop the omnicompatible piloting device known today as Taradon’s Helm.\n[P]Though many shipwrights and pilots have heard tales of the Helm, few could venture to describe its physical characteristics, much less its functions. The Helm is known to have been human-portable; hot-swappable into the hardware of dozens, if not hundreds, of different ship types; and capable of integrating piloting, navigation, and weapon systems into a discrete, maddeningly complicated interface. What is less well known is that Taradon imbued his unique invention with secret crystalline technologies that tap into the Force, enabling those who use it to channel their courage and wisdom into extraordinary acts of piloting derring-do.\n[P]In fact, the device now called the Helm (it is unknown by what name Taradon referred to it) is relatively small and bears more resemblance to a modern slicer’s gear than to surviving examples of early Republic starship control mechanisms. It takes the form of a control box studded with switches, buttons, and indicator lights, roughly rectangular but tapering to a conical point on one side. This cone, along with the leads that extend from it, is the interface point that connects Taradon’s Helm to the controls of almost any craft capable of flight, from simple atmospheric hoppers to interstellar dreadnoughts. The design is wickedly clever, with multiple methods available to connect the Helm to a ship, accounting for the mind- boggling array of craft it could augment.\n[P]Reinforced and rugged, the Helm is believed to have survived the crash that took Taradon’s life on Hum. It may be seen as ironic that this ace of the spacelanes and ship’s captain without peer died in a crash, but, in fact, other survivors of the battle in the planet’s frigid skies believed that Taradon of Corellia sacrificed himself in a successful last- ditch effort to fight off a force led by turncoat Jedi raiding for kyber crystals.\n[P]Taradon was flying in close action against a starfighter piloted by a rogue Jedi when they entered orbit around Hum. The traitor pilot was a Rodian Jedi turned assassin named Deelguh, whom Taradon had trained with as a young Padawan. Taradon had long sought to bring Deelguh to justice, only to be stymied time and again, as the Rodian was his near-equal as a pilot. Knowing that the fearsome fighter would become yet more dangerous if the raiding mission succeeded, Taradon knew the raid must be stopped. With Deelguh’s ship about to land, having successfully fought off Taradon’s attacks, the Corellian apparently chose to bring both vessels down in a fiery collision. Presumably unable to eject or unwilling to leave his ship behind, Taradon rode his burning craft all the way down to the surface, to his death. He died secure in the knowledge that Deelguh had also met his end.\n[P]Expeditions to investigate the crash site were never successful in locating the wrecked ship, but a careful examination of Taradon’s transmitted flight logs revealed an unidentifiable surge of energy coming from the Corellian’s navicomputer moments before his death. The Jedi who reviewed the logs theorized that it might have been a function of the legendary Taradon’s Helm, fighting to protect its master, a conclusion scoffed at by others, who said the Helm would never have disobeyed a command.\n[P]A Force-sensitive character who possesses Taradon’s Helm may reroll one [FORCE] when making checks that involve piloting or using a starship or vehicle.

Roundly derided by those who make their living with animals as a cheap shortcut used by quacks and animal haters, the Pacifier is designed to control a wild or otherwise uncontrollable animal through chems rather than training. Similar to a typical riding or restraining harness, the Pacifier is made of a sturdy and flexible synthetic weave that loops around a creature's ribs, chest, and shoulders with a heavy brace that sits at its withers. Built into the back brace is a refillable auto-hypo typically filled with a cocktail of behavior-controlling drugs. The auto-hypo is connected to a remote that can trigger the pump at up to close range, and is used in much the same way as a remote for a droid restraining bolt. While the drugs tend to make even the most cross-grained creature docile and biddable, they can also have a number of unforeseen side effects ranging from dulling a creature's intellect or senses to killing it with an overdose. \n\n[P]Using a Pacifier on a wild animal is a temporary fix at best, and should only be done in emergencies. Mounting the harness on a creature requires a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Survival check[b] to ensure the harness is fitted properly and the auto-hypo is situated correctly.

{"name":"Grimoire of Syclos the Lame","type":"gear","img":"modules/ffg-oggdude/artwork/gear/GearTALISGRIMSYC.png","data":{"description":"[H3]Grimoire of Syclos the Lame[h3]\nWhereas most citizens of other planets may believe the Force to be but a legend, on the Wild Space planet of Weik, the Force is known to exist without a doubt. Equally feared and celebrated, it is utilized by many of the world’s residents on a daily basis. It is not, however, understood in the manner propagated by the Jedi, or even the Sith. Instead, on Weik, the Force is viewed as magic.\n[P]Over the centuries since the unique culture of Weik arose in the wake of a crash landing, all the trappings and mysteries associated with fantasy holodramas and children’s tales have found real-world analogs on the planet. Ignorant of how the wider galaxy sees such things, the people of Weik are familiar with what they consider to be \"magical\" weapons and armor, encircled objects of power ranging from clothing to tools, and even, as in the case of the legendary Grimoire of Syclos the Lame, spellbooks.\n[P]Befitting its portentous name, the Grimoire is a large, leather-bound book, its cover tooled with mystic patterns, reinforced with bronze bosses, and liberally decorated with darkly sparkling gemstones. Central to the cover design is a glyph of power that only offplanet observers might recognize as a stylized, winged lightsaber. Of greater interest to most students of the Force, however, is the book’s contents.\n[P]Hand sewn into a cloth binding, some eight dozen gathers of parchment form 386 closely lined pages. The source of the parchment is a minor mystery among the many that surround the Grimoire. Though the Grimoire was clearly prepared in the manner traditional on Weik—from animal skins flayed, soaked, and stretched on frames—the green- gray color of its pages suggests that the skins used were not those of any animal known to the planet. Neither is the luminous ink used in scribbling the pages of a formula replicated in any other known Weik-produced book, whether “magical” or not.\n[P]The effect of the glowing amber ink against the background of gray and green would have offered a challenging reading experience even if Syclos the Lame—if she was in fact the scribe—had been an accomplished calligrapher. Unfortunately, whoever penned what have been called the book’s “mad ravings” was far more concerned with utilizing every square centimeter of available space than with legibility. It has been estimated that the Grimoire of Syclos the Lame contains more than a half-million individual words, whereas books of similar provenance and size usually contain around two hundred thousand, even when they are not so liberally embellished as the Grimoire.\n[P]It is those embellishments—or rather, their many reproductions—that have given this tome its fame on Weik. Taking the form of creatures out of nightmare, the capital letters heading each page are hollow-eyed, many-limbed monsters, rendered in glowing ink that seems to cause them to move on the page. No figure is repeated across the Grimoire’s pages, yielding a fiendish menagerie of beasts that would give pause even to far-traveled big game hunters of the wider galaxy. The Beasts of Syclos, as they are popularly known, may be found copied in many other volumes, and they have even been rendered in stone as rain-spouting gargoyles on Weik’s cathedrals and castles. Large mock versions of the creatures crafted from paper and daub are carried aloft on wooden poles through Weik’s villages. This occurs at sunset on the autumnal equinox, in a celebration known as the Feast of Worms.\n[P]But for all its local fame, the Grimoire has been little studied by the sages of Weik. The peculiarities of its production and the nigh-indecipherable scrawl of its scribbling would be daunting enough, but Weik is a place where legends are given great credence, and according to legend, to read the\nwords of Syclos the Lame is to invite madness. The secrets it unlocks are said to be sorely tempting for the power they offer, but the ultimate promise of the lame wizard’s teachings is death. The Grimoire’s information is said to be applicable to beasts across the galaxy, not just those located on Weik.\n[P]Studying the Grimoire of Syclos the Lame for at least one hour allows a Force-sensitive character to add [FO] to all Force power checks or checks involving Force talents when dealing with creatures detailed in the Grimoire.

{"name":"Crown of Verity","type":"gear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Crown of Verity[h3]\nIn the days of the Republic and even before, the Outer Rim world of Auratera, little visited now, attracted the attention of Force users from all over the galaxy. Its curious day-night cycle might have been enough to interest scouts and astronomers, but it was the presence of the powerful vergence of Acablas that drew Jedi, Sith, and other Force sensitives to the planet for millennia. Over the course of Auratera’s history, such visitors had varying degrees of success in penetrating the ruins around Acablas and coming to understand its mysteries.\n[P]At least one Jedi is known to have been studying Acablas on Auratera at the time of Order 66. Though he is presumed dead, the fate of the Ithorian Master Tobar Ka-Teen is unknown. What is known is that Ka-Teen had, with the permission of the Jedi Council, carried with him to Auratera a powerful and ancient Force artifact known as the Crown of Verity.\n[P]In surviving Jedi records, the so-called “Crown” is actually described as a silvered skullcap capable of altering its own size and shape so that it might be worn by any sentient possessed of a discernible head. The Crown of Verity is said to have been used as a symbol of office by the Magistrates of Benetage before that Outer Rim planet was mysteriously abandoned almost thirty thousand years ago. How it came to be held in the Jedi Temple at Coruscant is unknown. Force-sensitive beings who don the Crown find themselves simultaneously able to discern any lie and unable to utter any falsehood themselves.\n[P]His final, probably fatal trip to Auratera did not mark the first occasion on which Master Tobar Ka-Teen was allowed use of the Crown. His fascination with what constitutes truth had led the philosophy-minded Ithorian to make several studies of the artifact. He sought a way to duplicate its properties in other devices, and to expand and perfect the Jedi’s already considerable innate sensitivity to falsehoods.\n[P]Ka-Teen’s interest in truthtelling had a dark origin. Shortly after he was named a Jedi Master, the Ithorian fell afoul of the Black Sun criminal syndicate when he inadvertently interrupted their machinations aboard Kriost Station, a deep space trading outpost. Seeking to punish the Jedi for his interference, the Black Sun placed a bounty on Master Ka-Teen’s head, hiring a deeply corrupt human woman known as Kallyx the Piner to capture him and learn everything the Jedi Order knew about Black Sun activities by any means necessary.\n[P]“Piner” is an ancient and obscure term for torturer, and the weeks Tobar Ka-Teen spent under the knives of Kallyx before his rescue by fellow Jedi tested him beyond anything he had been trained for. However, to his astonishment, the gentle Ithorian found a capacity for something he had never thought possible in himself: lying.\n[P]Instead of revealing anything about Jedi operations or intelligence, Master Ka-Teen successfully wove a complex net of deception that ensnared Kallyx the Piner. Seeking to protect his fellow Jedi, Ka-Teen found his only option to be what he later described as “the abandonment of truth.\"\n[P]Despite being hailed as a hero by the Jedi Council, the Ithorian turned deeply inward following the episode, becoming an intensely private individual who spent more time alone in the libraries and archives of Coruscant than with his fellow Jedi Knights. Tobar Ka-Teen was seeking something elemental, and that search led him first to his studies of the Crown of Verity, and then, apparently, to the mysterious vergence on Auratera in the ruins of Acablas.\n[P]Though he was not a general and took little part in the Clone Wars, Ka-Teen was accompanied to Auratera by several squads of Republic troops. Order 66 was enacted during his scheduled stay on the planet, and there is no reason to believe he survived its execution. However, there is no record that the clone troops “guarding” him ever returned from Auratera, either. Thus, the planet is the last known location of the Crown of Verity, and of the Jedi Master who so desperately desired to understand its secrets.\n[P]A Force-sensitive character who dons the Crown of Verity automatically fails all Deception checks while wearing it.

Only recently introduced after years of research and development, RMS are small, squat, kite-shaped droids about a meter tall, with an armored, flat-topped head. Their burly arms are tipped with heavy weapons, and numerous dexterous manipulators for grasping and fine-motor work hang from their flat undercarriages. These droids move about via a baffled repulsorlift engine that makes little noise and produce almost no energy signature or emissions. Their personalities are laconic and no-nonsense, although those droids that go without their regular maintenance and memory wipes develop strange philosophical or artistic streaks. \n[P]RM-series droids specialize in military intelligence, specifically post-battle analytics and the study of enemy tactics and strategy. They are commonly dispatched to war zones to gather battlefield data and to observe how clashing forces fight in various galactic conditions. As this is an exceedingly dangerous task, these droids are well armored and carry an array of heavy anti-personnel and anti-droid weaponry. They are equipped with a sophisticated suite of intelligence-gathering and data analysis systems and come packed with optical, audio, chemical, energy, and other sensors. RMS also possess respectable engineering and infiltration programming that allows them to act as combat engineers and saboteurs when needed. Many Imperial camps have been flattened by an RM-series droid's homemade explosives and cunning trickery. \n[P]In Alliance and Imperial espionage circles, RM-series droids have gained a reputation as highly competent units that can be relied upon in the field.

{"name":"Herder's Gauntlet","type":"gear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Herder's Gauntlet[h3]\nThe Iktotchi people are blessed with the talents of precognition, an ability found to benefit from augmentation by the Force when their world was incorporated into the Republic thousands of years ago. Though their natural talent for foretelling the future fades exponentially the farther they travel from their home moon, Iktotchi Force sensitives, particularly among the Jedi, formulated many techniques to expand and refine their native precognitive abilities using the Force.\n[P]One common Force power that did not come naturally to the Iktotchi, however, was the ability to move objects at a distance. Their native precognition, in other words, did not translate automatically into skill with the Force ability that mimics telekinesis. Though Iktotchi Jedi more than made up for this with their mastery of other Force talents, the Jedi Master Needa Kame saw an opportunity in the seeming shortcoming.\n[P]Around 900 BBY, Needa Kame took a leave of absence from his Jedi duties and traveled to Iktotch for an extended period of meditation and study. He built a retreat in the mountains of that windswept moon, and devoted over a decade to developing the Force-imbued Gauntlet that bears his name. Exquisitely crafted from the hide and horns of a sure-footed ungulate native to the Iktotchi highlands, the Herder’s Gauntlet is, unsurprisingly, fitted for an Iktotchi, with larger fingers and a broader palm than a human’s.\n[P]During his years of working on the Gauntlet, Master Kame was not completely isolated. The inhabitants of the village closest to his simple dwelling frequently made the half-day trek to visit the Jedi, bringing him food and other supplies in exchange for advice, or out of simple neighborliness. Over time, the children of the village transitioned from fearing the strange old man to adopting him as a sort of eccentric grandfather. Needa Kame did not discourage this, being possessed of both a gentle soul and a sparkling sense of humor.\n[P]It was this latter quality that eventually led to the breakthrough that allowed the completion of the Herder’s Gauntlet. Through years of experimentation and tinkering, Master Kame had come frustratingly close to realizing his ambition of creating an aid for Iktotchi Force users unskilled at telekinesis time and time again, only to have some obstacle or oversight see him fall short. It was when the village children were visiting him on one occasion that the Jedi, wearing the Gauntlet because he had been working on it when they arrived, decided to amuse his guests with some legerdemain, showing off some perfectly mundane sleight-of-hand tricks he had learned at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant in his student days. But Needa Kame fumbled the trick he was performing (pulling a local fruit from behind a small girl’s ear), earning good hearted jeers from the children. At that moment, the Jedi experienced a revelation, realizing that his Gauntlet was as advanced as it ever need be. Instead, it was his application of the Force that had been wanting. Readdressing the problem, he centered himself, held out his gauntleted hand, and lifted the delighted little girl into the air.\n[P]A Force-sensitive character who wears the Herder’s Gauntlet counts as possessing the Move basic power, and may make a Move Force power action as a maneuver. A character who does so may not attack an opponent with this use of the Force power (what constitutes an attack is ultimately up to the GM, but should include disarming or incapacitating opponents as well as dealing damage).[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 110 - Nexus of Power[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":8000,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":9,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[],"adjusteditemmodifer":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"TALISHERDGAUNT"}},"_id":"UhBsXcIXNBNqnqRU"}

Arakyd Industries designed and produced this series in the years leading up to the Clone Wars in an ambitious but ultimately failed attempt to compete with Cybot Galactica's ubiquitous 3PO-series protocol droids. RA-7s are gawky, awkward-looking droids just under two meters tall, with spindly limbs, a head reminiscent of a Verpine's, and huge, bulbous photoreceptors that take up the majority of their face. Their personalities are, on the whole, dull and dry with an air of aloofness that few owners find tolerable. RA-7s that have gone without regular maintenance and memory wipes tend to be morose, pessimistic, and constantly exasperated with everyone and everything around them.\n[P]The RA-7 line's great failure, which ended Arakyd's plans for further expansion in the protocol droid market, is the fact that the droids offer nothing unique to their buyers. Their etiquette and protocol programming is respect- able, and their ability to analyze and collate data is actually quite remark- able, but there is nothing they do that Cybot Galactica's 5POs can't do cheaper, better, and more reliably. After years of dwindling sales and tens of thousands of unsold units, Arakyd canceled the line and offered its entire back stock to the Imperial armed forces at fire-sale prices. Only the ISB took Arakyd up on its offer, and only then, through modification and reprogramming, did the RA-1s find purpose.\n[P]The ISB thoroughly overhauled the thousands of RA-7s it purchased, installing new programming and upgrading the droids' sensor package. Each droid received a sophisticated intelligence-gathering system that included active and passive listening devices and multi-optic, high-resolution photoreceptors with numerous vision modes and the ability to record and transmit audio, video, and holographic data. A constant-on uplink to the ISB's secure HoloNet was installed to give RA-7s constant access to the ISB's expansive databases and to ensure the droids can upload the information they collect as they go about their business. All of these systems are cleverly hidden in plain sight throughout the droid's chassis, and the espionage programming looks like innocent etiquette and protocol subroutines when examined.\n[P]Once they were modified, the ISB deployed their RA-7 droids throughout the Imperial armed forces to keep tabs on Imperial personnel and root out criminals and traitors. Nearly all RA-7s currently active are in Imperial service. Very few have defected to or been stolen by the Alliance; those that have are considered to be nearly priceless thanks to their espionage and intelligence-gathering equipment and their knowledge of ISB protocols. Some models found other roles to play in the Rebellion. One RA-7, for example, escaped ISB reprogramming and served as an inventory specialist in one of the more infamous Rebel cells.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 53 - Cyphers and Masks[h4]","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":12000,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":6,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":true},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[],"adjusteditemmodifer":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"RA7PROTDROID"}},"_id":"UmiwJImvTELUlnF9"}

{"name":"Bardottan Sphere","type":"gear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Bardottan Sphere[h3]\nOne of the most powerful objects ever encountered by the legendary Jedi Master Mace Windu was the Bardottan Sphere, a Force artifact designed to capture the Force from living beings and store it as though in some battery. The Sphere could focus the captured energy into a Force wielder when certain mystical and gravitational effects were applied. Now held by the Dagoyan mystics of Bardotta, the Sphere became known on that planet when Master Windu rescued the Bardottan sovereign, Queen Julia, from the clutches of the Nightsisters, an organization of dark side Force adepts.\n[P]Whether the Nightsisters constructed the Sphere or discovered it is unknown, and the Bardottans have denied all requests to access the studies of the artifact that might reveal its provenance. Exhaustive records searches have found no mention of such an item either before or since Windu’s encounter with the Nightsisters. It seems likely the item is unique and was crafted by the Nightsisters or their allies shortly before its use during the events surrounding the kidnapping of Queen Julia.\n[P]In appearance, the Sphere is not particularly notable. It takes the form of a large crystalline sphere of milky transparency, its color dependent on the light it reflects. It is only when a Force-sensitive being attuned to the Sphere wills it to a semblance of mineral life that the Sphere glows with an internal light and works its “magic.” When activated in this manner, the Sphere forms a link with a nearby living creature, as directed by the controlling Force sensitive. In theory, this could be any living being, as the Force surrounds and penetrates all things, but in practice, the Nightsisters and their minions seem to have chosen only sentients as their targets. Once the link has been established, the Sphere cuts off the target’s connection with the Force and then drains the Force contained within the target’s living self, leaving behind a husk bereft of life. The exact mechanisms of this process are, as with so many Force artifacts, unclear. The Sphere is obviously not mechanical in nature, and neither can it be said to be living. It has been theorized that the Sphere, when inert, is in fact a sort of anti-Force artifact, cut off from the universe and reflecting the all-surrounding Force away from itself. If this is true, say those who hold this theory, then a type of “Force vacuum” exists within the bounds of the Sphere, one that naturally attracts the Force when the Sphere becomes active.\n[P]The Nightsisters did not use the Sphere as a simple tool of execution, however. The Sphere not only drains the Living Force from its victims, but also stores what it has stolen for a time. The Nightsisters could then tap into that stored Force, using it to fuel any number of Force powers to much\ngreater effect than they could on their own. The Bardottan Sphere, then, is a power booster for Force users, its power being purchased at the ultimate price, paid by those its users have targeted.\n[P]In its history and recorded use, the Sphere of the Nightsisters has been understood as a tool of evil and murder. To be sure, there is little to suggest that it was created with anything but the literal theft of life in mind. However, at least some of the Dagoyan mystics who guard the Sphere today are said to have taken on a more curatorial role, studying the Sphere with an eye toward using its considerable powers in a benign way, more in keeping with their relatively peaceful philosophies. These Bardottans have begun to agitate for more access to the Sphere, arguing that if they can plumb its mysteries, they can control its effects, and perhaps find ways to utilize its curious binary nature as an object that sometimes reflects the Force and sometimes absorbs it. The discussion about whether to pursue this course of action usually ends there, though, as those who wish to activate the Sphere have thus far been unable to formulate detailed plans for its use that meet with the approval of Bardotta's sovereign and the Dagoyan council. The activist scholar-mystics argue that they must first be allowed greater access to the Sphere before they can provide any such details, but their requests have been denied as being too fraught with potential danger.\n[P]While the Sphere is in a character’s possession, the character’s Force rating increases by one. If the character sacrifices a living being to store its life force in the Sphere, then the character’s Force rating increases by the Force rating of the sacrificed being, as long as that creature’s Force rating was 1 or higher. However, a character who uses the Sphere during a session gains 5 Conflict at the at the end of the session, in addition to any Conflict accrued due to any sacrifices the character makes to power the Sphere.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 109 - Nexus of Power[h4]<div>Add Force Rating Mod - Add 1 to Force Rating </div>","attributes":{},"quantity":{"value":1,"type":"Number","label":"Quantity","abrev":"Qty"},"encumbrance":{"value":0,"type":"Number","label":"Encumbrance","abrev":"Encum","adjusted":0},"price":{"value":50000,"type":"Number","label":"Price","adjusted":0},"rarity":{"value":10,"type":"Number","label":"Rarity","adjusted":0,"isrestricted":false},"itemattachment":[],"itemmodifier":[{"_id":"hbJbbJ2K84r9VWAj","name":"Add Force Rating Mod","type":"itemmodifier","img":"/systems/starwarsffg/images/mod-all.png","data":{"description":"Add 1 to Force Rating","attributes":{},"itemmodifier":[],"adjusteditemmodifer":[],"type":"all","rank":1},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"FORCEADD"}},"id":"lfgsoj50wsrltlle"}],"adjusteditemmodifer":[]},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"Itz0X4muSsVNH8FV":3},"flags":{"starwarsffg":{"ffgimportid":"TALISBARDOTSPH"}},"_id":"Z3HtDwkChPw01z1n"}

{"name":"Tear of the Elders","type":"gear","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":"[H3]Tear of the Elders[h3]\nBefore humans ever came to Naboo, another starfaring species discovered the Gungans in Naboo’s swamps and seas. Little is known about these so-called “Elders” beyond what can be gleaned from the statuary they left behind on the planet and on Rori, one of the planet’s three moons. The Elders, it is theorized, were humanlike in appearance, though even that conjecture is only tenable if the enormous faces of their monuments are held to be representative of the Elders themselves, which is far from certain. Another theory, based on certain features of the faces, holds that the Elders were Force users. This would seem even more tenuous than other beliefs concerning their physiology, were it not for the existence of a Force artifact known as the Tear of the Elders.\n[P]Long treasured by the Gungans, the Tear of the Elders is a fist-sized piece of granitic rock, shaped, as its name suggests, in a teardrop formation. Teams of Gungan geologists and artisans who analyzed the Tear uncovered three crucial facts. First, it is formed of the same substance the Elders used in their statues, a rock matrix native to Naboo and its moons. Second, none of the hundreds of known examples of Elder statuary depict tears. Finally, unlike the monumental statues, the Tear has no toolmarks of any kind. These facts, along with the Tear’s shape, would suggest that it is an unlikely, but not impossible, naturally occurring stone form, were it not for the widely known legend about it.\n[P]According to this legend (Gungan scholars insist that it is historical truth, though they can offer no documentary evidence supporting their claim), sometime in the long years between the departure of the Elders and the first visits to Naboo by humans, the Gungan people adopted the relics of the Elders into their religion in practices that continue to this day. The isolated monuments of the Elders are considered holy sites, and they are venerated as places of great power. It was at one of these sites—the Gungans do not say which, specifically—that the event they call “Tearfall” occurred.\n[P]Force sensitivity is neither rarer nor more frequent among the Gungans than the galactic average, so it is no surprise that before the rise of the Republic and the founding of the Jedi Order, some few Gungans evinced powers that would now be recognized as Force-based. One such Gungan, his name lost to history, was the resident guardian of an Elder statue. In the course of his meditations, this Gungan cast his awareness out into the world, eventually becoming so skilled that he could sense events over the whole surface of Naboo, and even beyond. On the day he sat before the Elder statue and sensed the first human scout ships entering orbit, a great and unaccountable grief overcame the Gungan mystic. When he looked up, he saw a gray tear impossibly welling up in the stone face he sat before. Holding out his hand, he caught the Tear of the Elders in his hand as it fell.[P][H3]Sources:[h3][H4]Page 107 - Nexus of Power[h4]<div>Once per session, a Force-sensitive character may make a Force power check.

The final result was a droid that could operate in any part of the galaxy, but with considerably less effectiveness than a more specialized model.

Using the development of IA's R6-series astromechs as cover, the R7 project set out to build the most competent and reliable astromech droid ever produced.

A large holoprojector lens dominates the front face of the droid, and a small, high-output repulsorlift generator provides propulsion and gives the M4 a surprising burst of speed when needed. As dedicated messenger droids, M4s are equipped with a high-resolution holoprojector and an on-board memory that can store a single message up to five minutes long.

Their bodies are heavily reinforced and fitted with solid armor that can turn shots from light-caliber slugthrowers and low-powered blasters with ease.

These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. \n\n[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. \n\n[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one. \n\n[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without wining the tenor of the game. \n\n[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses. \n\n[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user. [B]Two skills, determined by the holocron, become career skills for the holocron's user as long as it remains in the user's possession.[b] What these skills are depends on the holocron in question (see [B]Table 2-7: Holocron Skills[b], on page 109, for some examples of skill pairs). Further, some holocrons grant additional bonuses. Some bonuses are ongoing, but others take effect only once.

These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. \n\n[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. \n\n[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one. \n\n[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives.

These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. \n\n[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. \n\n[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there. Some few survived and are still at large throughout the galaxy, but with the proscription on the ownership of Jedi artifacts and rarity of holocrons, it's a rare person who has even heard of a holocron, let alone knows where to locate one. \n\n[P]In [B]Force and Destiny[b], holocrons are more the goal of a quest or entire campaign rather than an item to be purchased or checked out of the local archives. Extremely rare and powerful, holocrons in a [B]Force and Destiny [b] game can have far-reaching consequences. Game Masters should be extremely cautious when introducing a holocron into a game. The following guidelines are presented to assist Game Masters in Introducing one of these powerful and desirable artifacts without wining the tenor of the game. \n\n[P]Depending on its nature, a holocron can grant new Force powers, increase the damage of a specific kind of attack (Melee, Ranged, Gunnery, Lightsaber, etc.), grant basic or advanced talents, grant or increase a skill, or anything else a Game Master can imagine. On his first attempt to use a holocron, a character must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Knowledge (Lore) check[b] to activate the device and summon the gatekeeper. Once the holocron is activated, the character who activated it must spend an amount of time dictated by the Came Master studying the holocron and conversing with the gatekeeper before benefiting from whatever bonuses the holocron provides. The character does not have to make the check to activate the Holocron on subsequent uses. \n\n[P]All holocrons, unless noted otherwise, grant an ongoing benefit to the user.

Unusual (some would say impossible) features of the planet’s ecology, topology, and atmosphere lend credence to theories that the Force saturates the very crust of the planet, and the existence of the artifact known as the Dram of Orphne adds further support.\n[P]The bifurcated world of Aleen is divided into the surface world, populated by the gregarious and relatively well- known Aleena people, and a mysterious Underworld, ruled by the towering, treelike Kindalo. The division between the two peoples and their environments is absolute. For centuries, it was thought that only the world’s massive arbozoic trees could be said to cross the boundary between the two worlds of Aleen. But during the Clone Wars, a creature out of legend revealed itself. Members of a Republic relief force encountered an Underworld being known as Orphne—neither Aleena nor Kindalo, but of some other, unknown species—a sylphlike being who spoke in riddles.\n[P]When those Republic personnel found themselves trapped in the Underworld, they only escaped when they managed to puzzle out the answer to a conundrum posed in verse by Orphne. Critical to their escape was their physical location. By solving the riddle, they moved within what has come to be known as Orphne’s Fountain, a sophisticated device based on either unknown technology or on the Force itself. Orphne’s Fountain transported the trapped Republic personnel from the Underworld to the surface on a massive jet of water. A phenomenon practically unknown on the relatively arid planet, this unexpected event is well remembered by the Aleena.\n[P]According to official Republic records, what happened next was relatively straightforward. A breach between Aleen’s surface and subterranean worlds was sealed, ending the groundquakes that had necessitated the Republic relief effort in the first place. However, unknown to the commanders of the clone forces on the planet, agents of then-Chancellor Palpatine had been secreted among the medical and support staff sent to their division. One of these agents, acting on standing orders to record any unusual phenomena possibly related to the Force, collected a sample of the water of Or- phne’s Fountain. The agent planned to smuggle the sample offworld to Coruscant.\n[P]Why what has become known as the Dram of Orphne never made it off Aleen is unclear. It is possible that the agent was discovered and countered (or even eliminated) by either the Aleena or even the Kindalo, perhaps acting at the behest of Orphne. The vial is currently held by Aleena mystics, who have enshrined it at the center of one of the colossal statues they tend.

These fist-sized constructs were first created long ago by the Jedi and the Sith to record and store the knowledge and hard-won experience of members of their respective orders. Made from unique crystals encased in layers of precious metals and polycarbonites, these devices use advanced hologrammatic technology to map and store the contents of a single individual's neural pathways. In essence, holocrons record the memories and knowledge of a particular Jedi or Dark Lord of the Sith and store it for future reference. \n\n[P]Holocrons are accessed through an advanced holographic operating system based on the personality of the individual upon whom the holocron is imprinted. These gatekeepers act as a user interface, search-and-recovery program, and security system. Once activated, a small hologram of the holocron's namesake is projected above the device. The gatekeeper is then addressed, and can teach lessons, answer questions, or simply engage in conversation with the user. Remarkably intelligent and observant, holocron gatekeepers use latent Force energies to read the motives and personality of the user, in order to tailor the user's experience to his level of skill, experience, and trustworthiness. Some gatekeepers, especially those created by the Sith or who have become corrupt over the centuries, can even lie to and lead astray an unsuspecting user, often doing irreparable damage. \n\n[P]Most known holocrons were kept at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and the majority of those were lost during the Great Purge when Darth Sidious raided the Holocron Archives and either confiscated or destroyed everything he found there.

However, where the beast call uses sound and recording technology, the Beastmaster does so through the use of pheromones. Small and easy to conceal (around the size of a typical datapad), the Beastmaster contains an exhaustive database listing the genetic codes of most known species in the galaxy. With the creature database and an onboard testing and recording suite that contains a DNA sequencer and a chemical synthesizer, the Beastmaster can create nearly any pheromone, musk, or other biological secretion. It can also be programmed with new DNA if it is provided with a physical sample such as blood, hair, skin, or bone. \n\n[P]To use, a hunter first chooses his creature from the database or creates a new entry with a sample. Then he simply conceals the chemical lure, retreats to an upwind location, and settles in to wait. The Beastmaster uses the DNA information stored in the database to synthesize the correct chemical, aerosolizes it, and then slowly releases it over the course of one standard hour. The synthetic pheromones are incredibly hard for a targeted beast to resist, and the Beastmaster typically has a better chance of luring in its prey than a beast call or other apparatus. \n\n[P]Creatures targeted by the Beastmaster must make a [B]Hard ([DI][DI][DI]) Discipline check[b] to resist, otherwise they come as quickly as possible to investigate. These items are often used with electro-snares or other live-trapping equipment to capture exotic animals alive for use as pets, zoo animals, and research subjects.
